import Exchangeability.Probability.DeFinetti

/-!
This project is centred on the formalisation of de Finetti's theorem.  The
`Exchangeability` library currently re-exports the probability namespace containing
the statement and supporting scaffolding for the result.

## New modules (Mean Ergodic approach)

The mean-ergodic proof of de Finetti (following Kallenberg 2005) is developed in
additional modules under `Probability/DeFinetti`. These files remain under
active development and are not imported by default until their outstanding
`sorry`s are resolved.
