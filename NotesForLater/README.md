# NotesForLater - Historical Development Notes

**Status**: Archived/WIP materials from the development of de Finetti's theorem formalization.

These documents capture ideas, techniques, and plans generated during active development (Oct 2025 - Jan 2026). Some content may be outdated now that all three proofs are complete.

## For Zulip Readers

If you're reviewing this codebase from a Zulip link:
- The main proofs are in `Exchangeability/DeFinetti/`
- All three proof approaches (ViaMartingale, ViaL2, ViaKoopman) are **complete**
- Paper planning has moved to `paper/`
- Current status is in `STATUS.md` at the repo root
