# Custom workflow for blueprint + homepage deployment.
# Blueprint is pre-built locally and committed to repo.
#
# TODO: When upgrading to Lean 4.26.0+, switch to docgen-action:
#   uses: leanprover-community/docgen-action@main
#   with:
#     blueprint: true
#     homepage: home_page
#
# The docgen-action `:docs` facet doesn't work with Lean 4.24.0 but works
# with 4.26.0 (see brownian-motion project for working example).
