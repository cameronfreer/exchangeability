# Contractability and the de Finetti-Ryll-Nardzewski Theorem

This file establishes the relationship between exchangeability and contractability,
following Kallenberg's "Probabilistic Symmetries and Invariance Principles" (2005).

## Main definitions

* `Contractable`: A sequence is contractable if all increasing subsequences of equal length
  have the same distribution.
* `ConditionallyIID`: A sequence is conditionally i.i.d. if it is i.i.d. given some σ-field.
* `MixedIID`: A sequence is mixed i.i.d. if its distribution is a mixture of i.i.d. distributions.

## Main results

* `FullyExchangeable.exchangeable`: Full exchangeability implies (finite) exchangeability.
* `contractable_of_exchangeable`: Exchangeable implies contractable (via permutation extension).
* `exchangeable_of_conditionallyIID`: Conditionally i.i.d. implies exchangeable.

## Note on the de Finetti equivalences

The full de Finetti-Ryll-Nardzewski theorem establishes: contractable ↔ exchangeable ↔ conditionally i.i.d.

This file proves the "easy" directions:
- Exchangeable → contractable (via permutation extension)
- Conditionally i.i.d. → exchangeable (via product measure permutation invariance)

The "hard" directions requiring ergodic theory are stated and proved in `Exchangeability/DeFinetti.lean`
using one of three approaches (L2, Koopman, or martingale):
- Contractable → exchangeable (needs mean ergodic theorem)
- Exchangeable → conditionally i.i.d. (needs ergodic decomposition for Borel spaces)

The separate direction (exchangeable → fully exchangeable) is in `Exchangeability/Exchangeability.lean`.

This is weaker than exchangeability, which requires equality for all permutations,
