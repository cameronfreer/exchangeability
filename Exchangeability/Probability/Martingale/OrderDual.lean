# OrderDual Infrastructure for Martingale Convergence

This section shows why reindexing via OrderDual ℕ cannot convert Lévy's upward theorem
into the downward theorem.

## Main Results

- `Filtration.ofAntitone`: Package a decreasing sequence as an increasing filtration on ℕᵒᵈ
- `iSup_ofAntitone_eq_F0`: For antitone F, ⨆ i, F i.ofDual = F 0 (not ⨅ n, F n!)

/-- Package a decreasing family of σ-algebras on `ℕ` as an increasing filtration on `ℕᵒᵈ`.

For a decreasing sequence (𝔽 n) of σ-algebras, this creates an increasing filtration on
`OrderDual ℕ` where `𝔾 i := 𝔽 (ofDual i)`. Since `i ≤ j` in `ℕᵒᵈ` iff `ofDual j ≤ ofDual i`
in `ℕ`, antitonicity of 𝔽 becomes monotonicity of 𝔾. -/

/-- For an antitone chain of σ-algebras, the supremum equals the first term.

**Key insight:** For an antitone sequence F : ℕ → MeasurableSpace Ω, we have
  ⨆ i : ℕᵒᵈ, F i.ofDual = F 0
because F n ≤ F 0 for all n (by antitonicity), and F 0 is one of the terms.

**Why the OrderDual approach fails:** This shows that reindexing via ℕᵒᵈ cannot turn
⨆ into ⨅. For example, if F 0 = ⊤ and F n = ⊥ for n > 0, then:
  ⨆ i, F i.ofDual = ⊤  but  ⨅ n, F n = ⊥
Therefore, applying Lévy's upward theorem to the OrderDual filtration would give
convergence to μ[f | F 0], not μ[f | ⨅ n, F n]. -/
