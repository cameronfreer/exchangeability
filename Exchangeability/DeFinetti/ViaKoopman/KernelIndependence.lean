/-! # Kernel Independence Framework (EXTRAS - Exchangeability Route)

This file contains the **exchangeability-based** kernel independence framework for de Finetti's
theorem. This is an alternative approach to the main contractability-based proof.

**Status:** Contains sorries for the kernel independence π-λ extension (blocked on Kernel autoParam
API issues). The main Koopman proof uses `ContractableFactorization.lean` instead, which is
complete with no sorries.

**Note:** The essential directing kernel definitions (`π0`, `rcdKernel`, `ν`,
`integral_ν_eq_integral_condExpKernel`) are also available in `DirectingKernel.lean` for
files that only need those definitions without the independence machinery.

## Sorries in this file

The following lemmas have sorries (documented proof strategies):

1. `condexp_product_factorization_consecutive` (line ~905): π-λ extension for kernel independence
2. `condexp_product_factorization_general` (line ~1159): permutation equivariance
3. Related helper sorries at lines ~1241, ~1900

These are blocked on Kernel autoParam API issues in mathlib. See `ContractableFactorization.lean`
for the alternative sorry-free approach via contractability.

/-! ## Bridge lemmas for de Finetti's theorem

These lemmas bridge kernel-level and measure-level independence concepts.
They isolate the genuinely difficult parts (measurable selection, conditional independence)
and allow the rest of the proof to proceed mechanically.
-/

/-- Bridge from kernel independence to measure-level integral factorization.

Given `Kernel.IndepFun X Y κ μ`, for a.e. a we have `IndepFun X Y (κ a)` at the measure level,
which gives integral factorization via `IndepFun.integral_mul_eq_mul_integral`.

**Proof outline:**
1. `Kernel.IndepFun` gives: ∀ s t measurable, ∀ᵐ a, κ a (X⁻¹(s) ∩ Y⁻¹(t)) = κ a (X⁻¹(s)) * κ a (Y⁻¹(t))
2. Use countable generators {Iic q | q : ℚ} for Borel ℝ (borel_eq_generateFrom_Iic_rat)
3. Apply `ae_all_iff` to swap: (∀ q r : ℚ, ∀ᵐ a, ...) ↔ (∀ᵐ a, ∀ q r, ...)
4. For a.e. a, independence on π-system generators extends to full σ-algebra
5. Apply `IndepFun.integral_mul_eq_mul_integral` for each a

/-- **Composition lemma**: Independence is preserved under composition with measurable functions.

If X and Y are kernel-independent, then f ∘ X and g ∘ Y are also kernel-independent
for any measurable functions f and g.

**Proof strategy**:

- For measurable f, comap (f ∘ X) ⊆ comap X (preimages under f∘X are preimages under X)

/-- **Bridge lemma**: The Mean Ergodic Theorem projection equals conditional expectation
onto the shift-invariant σ-algebra.

**Statement**: For a measure-preserving shift on path space,
  `metProjection shift hσ = condexpL2`

**Proof strategy**:
1. Both are orthogonal projections onto the same subspace in L²(μ)
2. The fixed-point subspace `{f : f ∘ shift = f}` equals the subspace of
   shiftInvariantSigma-measurable functions
3. By uniqueness of orthogonal projections, they must be equal

**Key insight**: Functions invariant under the Koopman operator (f ∘ shift = f) are
precisely those measurable with respect to the shift-invariant σ-algebra. This
connects the ergodic-theoretic perspective (fixed points of dynamics) with the
probabilistic perspective (conditional expectation onto a sub-σ-algebra).

The following two lemmas were removed because they are dead code:

- `kernel_integral_product_factorization` was only used in `condexp_pair_factorization` which is dead code

directly via the Mean Ergodic Theorem without needing kernel-level independence.

/-- **Pull-out property with conditional expectation factor on the left**.

For bounded measurable X and integrable Y:
  CE[X · CE[Y| mSI] | mSI] = CE[Y| mSI] · CE[X| mSI]

This is the correct "take out what is known" rule with the m-measurable factor CE[Y| mSI]
on the left. The factor CE[Y| mSI] is m-ae-strongly-measurable, so we can apply the
standard pull-out lemma from mathlib.

**Why the naive "tower for products" CE[X·CE[Y| mSI]| mSI] = CE[X·Y| mSI] is FALSE:**
Taking m = {∅,Ω} (trivial σ-algebra), the naive identity reduces to:
  E[X·E[Y]] = E[X·Y]
which only holds when Cov(X,Y) = 0. This is not true in general.

**Proof strategy:** Use `condExp_mul_of_aestronglyMeasurable_left` from mathlib with:
- Left factor: CE[Y| mSI] (m-ae-strongly-measurable by stronglyMeasurable_condExp)
- Right factor: X (bounded, hence integrable on finite measure space)
- Product: CE[Y| mSI]·X is integrable by Integrable.bdd_mul'

**Status:** Axiomatized due to Lean 4 type class instance issues with multiple
measurable space structures. The mathematical content is straightforward.

**Proof sketch** (blocked by type class synthesis):
1. Use commutativity: X * μ[Y | m] = μ[Y | m] * X
2. μ[Y | m] is m-strongly-measurable (by stronglyMeasurable_condExp)
3. X is integrable (bounded on finite measure space)

/-! ### Option A: Projected Mean Ergodic Theorem

This section implements the "project first, then average" approach that avoids
the ambient/sub-σ-algebra mismatch entirely.

**Mathematical idea**: For T-invariant m, conditional expectation commutes with
composition by T, so the m-projected Birkhoff averages are constant:

  𝔼[Birkhoff average | m] = 𝔼[f | m]  for all n

This bypasses the need to identify the Koopman fixed-point subspace with Lp(m).
-/

/-! ### Option A Supporting Lemmas (COMMENTED OUT - TYPE CLASS SYNTHESIS ISSUES)

The following lemmas implement the "project first, then average" approach but are
currently broken due to Lean 4's type class synthesis with sub-σ-algebras. Even with
the naming pattern `[mΩ : MeasurableSpace Ω]` and `hm : m ≤ mΩ`, mathlib lemmas
synthesize `m` when they should infer `mΩ`, causing 18+ type class errors.

These lemmas are kept for reference but commented out. See `MET_IMPLEMENTATION_FINDINGS.md`
in the deprecated docs for details on the type class synthesis issues.
-/

/-
/-- **Key lemma**: Conditional expectation onto a T-invariant σ-algebra commutes
with precomposition by T.

If `m` is a sub-σ-algebra such that `T⁻¹ s = s` for all `m`-measurable `s`, then
for any integrable `f`:

  𝔼[f ∘ T | m] = 𝔼[f | m]  (μ-a.e.)

**Proof sketch**:
1. Both sides are characterized by their integrals over `m`-measurable sets
2. For `A ∈ m`: `∫ (f ∘ T) · 1_A dμ = ∫ f · 1_{T⁻¹ A} dμ`
3. Since `T⁻¹ A = A` and T is measure-preserving, these equal `∫ f · 1_A dμ`
4. Therefore the conditional expectations agree a.e.

/-- **Projected MET**: The conditional expectation of Birkhoff averages onto a
T-invariant σ-algebra is constant and equals 𝔼[f | m].

This is the "project first, then average" approach that completely bypasses the
ambient/sub-σ-algebra mismatch in the Koopman infrastructure.

**Corollary**: This immediately implies the L² convergence statement, since a
constant sequence trivially converges in any norm.

/-- **Helper lemma**: Kernel independence implies CE factorization for products.

If X and Y are conditionally independent given a σ-algebra m (as kernels),
then their conditional expectation factors: CE[X·Y | mSI] =ᵐ CE[X | mSI]·CE[Y | mSI].

This is the bridge between `Kernel.IndepFun` and conditional expectation factorization.

/-- **Axiomized product factorization** for general finite cylinder products.

**Proof Strategy** (Induction on m):
- **Base case** (m = 0): Product of empty family is 1, trivial ✓ (proved)
- **Inductive step**: Requires conditional independence machinery
  * Apply `condindep_pair_given_tail` to show independence
  * Use inductive hypothesis on first m factors
  * Apply `Kernel.IndepFun.comp` to compose with product function
  * Multiply factorizations using `condExp_mul_of_indep`

This extends conditional independence from pairs to finite products.
The inductive step requires full conditional independence infrastructure.

**IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS** (2025-12-10):

**Key available lemmas (fully proved!)**:

1. **Kernel → CE factorization bridge** (`condExp_mul_of_indep` above):
   For X, Y bounded measurable with kernel-level independence hypothesis `hindep`,
   we get `μ[X * Y | m] =ᵐ[μ] μ[X | m] * μ[Y | m]`

2. **Kernel independence ⇒ hindep** (`Kernel.IndepFun.integral_mul`):
   From `Kernel.IndepFun X Y κ μ` we get the `hindep` to feed into `condExp_mul_of_indep`

**What hciid should really be**:
The `True` placeholder should become a genuine independence hypothesis:
```lean
(hciid : ProbabilityTheory.Kernel.iIndepFun
          (fun k : ℕ => fun (ω : Ω[α]) => ω k)
          (condExpKernel μ (shiftInvariantSigma (α := α))) μ)
```
or some finite-index restriction of that.

**Inductive step structure** (once hciid is real):
```lean
| succ n IH =>
  classical
  -- Split product into "head" and "tail"
  let X : Ω[α] → ℝ := fun ω => fs 0 (ω 0)           -- Head
  let Y : Ω[α] → ℝ := fun ω =>                      -- Tail
    ∏ i : Fin n, fs (Fin.succ i) (ω (Fin.succ i))

  have hX_meas : Measurable X := (hmeas 0).comp (measurable_pi_apply 0)
  have hY_meas : Measurable Y := Finset.measurable_prod _ (fun i _ =>
    (hmeas _).comp (measurable_pi_apply _))

  have hX_bd : ∃ C, ∀ ω, |X ω| ≤ C := ...  -- from hbd 0
  have hY_bd : ∃ C, ∀ ω, |Y ω| ≤ C := ...  -- combine bounds for fs (succ i)

  -- Independence of X and Y w.r.t. condExpKernel (from hciid via Kernel.IndepFun.comp)
  have h_indep_XY : Kernel.IndepFun X Y (condExpKernel μ (shiftInvariantSigma (α := α))) μ := by
    -- Use hciid.indepFun_finset (S := {0} ∪ {1,…,n})
    -- then compose with fs's and product map via Kernel.IndepFun.comp
    admit

  -- Get kernel-level factorization
  have h_kernel := Kernel.IndepFun.integral_mul h_indep_XY hX_meas hY_meas hX_bd hY_bd

  -- Turn into CE factorization using condExp_mul_of_indep
  have h_ce_fac : μ[X * Y | shiftInvariantSigma (α := α)]
      =ᵐ[μ] μ[X | shiftInvariantSigma (α := α)] * μ[Y | shiftInvariantSigma (α := α)] :=
    condExp_mul_of_indep μ (hm := shiftInvariantSigma_le (α := α))
      hX_meas hY_meas hX_bd hY_bd h_kernel

  -- Rewrite X*Y as (n+1)-fold product, simplify RHS using IH + coordinate 0 lemma
  ...
```

The "hard" step is constructing `h_indep_XY` from `hciid` using CondIndep.lean machinery.

        -- 1. Define π_i := {s : Set Ω[α] | ∃ A, MeasurableSet A ∧ s = {ω | ω i ∈ A}}
        --    (cylinder sets for coordinate i)
        --
        -- 2. Show iIndepSets π κ μ from hciid:
        --    - For any finset S and f with f i ∈ π i for i ∈ S
        --    - Extract A_i via Classical.choice from the π membership
        --    - Apply hciid with the A_i to get the factorization
        --    (This step is implemented above before being simplified)
        --
        -- 3. Define m_i := comap (ω ↦ ω i) (MeasurableSpace α) (coordinate σ-algebra)
        --
        -- 4. Show π_i is a π-system (closed under finite intersections)
        --
        -- 5. Show m_i = generateFrom (π_i) by antisymmetry:
        --    - comap ≤ generateFrom: comap sets are in π (by definition)
        --    - generateFrom ≤ comap: π sets are comap-measurable

/-- **Generalized product factorization** for arbitrary coordinate indices.

This extends `condexp_product_factorization_consecutive` from coordinates `ω 0, ω 1, ...`
to arbitrary indices `ω (k 0), ω (k 1), ...`.

**Proof Strategy**: Use shift-invariance to reduce to the standard case.
For any coordinate selection `k : Fin m → ℕ`, we can relate it to the
standard selection via shifts, then apply the shift equivariance of CE.

**IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS** (2025-12-10):

**Key available lemmas**:
- `condexp_precomp_iterate_eq` (line ~747, proved):
  For any integrable F : Ω[α] → ℝ and any j:
  `μ[(fun ω => F ((shift^[j]) ω)) | shiftInvariantSigma] =ᵐ[μ] μ[F | shiftInvariantSigma]`

**Detailed proof strategy**:
1. For each i, define `g i : Ω[α] → ℝ := fun ω => fs i (ω 0)`
2. Note: `fs i (ω (k i)) = g i ((shift^[k i]) ω)`
3. Define:
   ```lean
   F : Ω[α] → ℝ := fun ω => ∏ i, g i ω               -- product at coordinate 0
   F' : Ω[α] → ℝ := fun ω => ∏ i, g i ((shift^[k i]) ω)  -- integrand in _general
   ```
   F' is the integrand here, F is the one for `condexp_product_factorization_consecutive`

4. Using `condexp_precomp_iterate_eq` repeatedly + integrability of finite products:
   `μ[F' | shiftInvariantSigma] =ᵐ[μ] μ[F | shiftInvariantSigma]`
   for each coordinate shift pattern

5. Conclude:
   ```lean
   have h_fact := condexp_product_factorization_consecutive μ hσ hExch m fs hmeas hbd
   -- h_fact : μ[F | ℐ] =ᵐ[μ] (ω ↦ ∏ i, ∫ fs i dν(ω))
   -- From step (4): μ[F' | ℐ] =ᵐ[μ] μ[F | ℐ]
   -- Compose these a.e.-equalities to get the desired result
   ```

**Dependencies**: Once `condexp_product_factorization_consecutive` is done, this follows from:
- `condexp_precomp_iterate_eq`
- Measurability/integrability lemmas (already available)
The only genuinely hard part is still the independence in `condexp_product_factorization_consecutive`.

    -- 2. Choose permutation π such that π(i) = k(i) for i < n+1
    -- 3. Under reindex π⁻¹: ∏ i, fs i (ω (k i)) = ∏ i, fs i ((reindex π⁻¹ ω) i)
    -- 4. Apply condexp_product_factorization_consecutive to the reindexed sequence
    -- 5. Use that shiftInvariantSigma is preserved under finite permutations

    -- The technical challenge is showing that CE[f | ℐ] is equivariant under
    -- permutations that fix the tail (i.e., finite-support permutations).
    -- This follows from:
    -- - hExch: μ ∘ (reindex π)⁻¹ = μ
    -- - shiftInvariantSigma is generated by tail events, which are preserved by finite perms
    -- - CE[f ∘ reindex π⁻¹ | ℐ] = CE[f | ℐ] ∘ reindex π⁻¹ for finite-support π

Orphaned code from proof attempt removed - was 620 lines of unfinished inductive step.
The proof strategy was documented in the doc comment above the lemma.

Key outline of what was here:
- Product split via Fin.prod_univ_succAbove at maximum coordinate
- Tower property application (CE[CE[f|m₁]|m₂] = CE[f|m₂])
- Pullout property (CE[X·CE[Y|m]|m] = CE[X|m]·CE[Y|m])
- Inductive hypothesis application
- Lag constancy lemma application

/- **Bridge lemma** for ENNReal version needed by `CommonEnding`.

**Proof Strategy**:
1. Apply `condexp_product_factorization_consecutive` to indicator functions
   - Indicators are bounded measurable functions
   - Product of indicators gives cylinder set probabilities

2. Integrate both sides:
   - LHS: ∫ CE[∏ indicators | ℐ] dμ
   - RHS: ∫ ∏(∫ indicator dν) dμ
   - Use tower property: ∫ CE[f | ℐ] dμ = ∫ f dμ

3. Convert from ℝ to ENNReal:
   - Use ENNReal.ofReal properties
   - Indicators take values in [0,1], so conversion is clean

This connects the conditional expectation factorization to measure-theoretic form.

**Proof structure note** (191 lines, lines 2653-2843):
Well-structured proof with clear sections:
- Setup: Define F (real-valued product) and G (kernel product)
- Prove F, G measurable, bounded, integrable
- Show ∫ F = ∫ G using tower property and condexp_product_factorization_consecutive
- Convert to ENNReal using ofReal_integral correspondence

The proof is straightforward measure theory with clear dependencies. No subdivision needed.

**Proof**: Apply `CommonEnding.conditional_iid_from_directing_measure` with:
1. Measurability of coordinates: `measurable_pi_apply`
2. Probability kernel ν: from `IsMarkovKernel.isProbabilityMeasure`
3. Measurability of ν: from `ν_eval_measurable` (for measurable sets)
4. Bridge condition: from `indicator_product_bridge`

Note: `conditional_iid_from_directing_measure` was updated to only require
measurability for measurable sets, matching what `ν_eval_measurable` provides.

/-- The "extreme members agree" lemma (Kallenberg's key step).

For a cylinder function F depending on coordinates i₁, ..., iₘ, the Birkhoff
averages (1/n)∑ⱼ F(shiftʲ ω) converge to a limit that depends only on the
shift-invariant σ-algebra. When we shift all indices by a large amount, the limit
is the same. This implies that the conditional expectation must have a product form.

/-- ν evaluation is measurable w.r.t. the shift-invariant σ-algebra.

NOTE: The construction `rcdKernel := Kernel.comap ... id (measurable_id'' ...)` uses
`measurable_id''` to witness that `id : shiftInvariantSigma → MeasurableSpace.pi` is
measurable. However, the resulting kernel has type `Kernel (Ω[α]) α` where the source
still uses the full `MeasurableSpace.pi` structure.

The tail-measurability should follow from properties of `Kernel.comap`, but requires
careful type-level reasoning about how `comap` modifies measurability structure.

For downstream uses, `ν_eval_measurable` (w.r.t. full σ-algebra) is usually sufficient.

/- The kernel `ν` is measurable with respect to the tail σ-algebra.

Note: This property should follow from the construction via condExpKernel, but requires
careful handling of measurable space parameters. The condExpKernel is defined as
`@Kernel Ω Ω m mΩ`, i.e., measurable w.r.t. the sub-σ-algebra m on the source.

TODO pipeline for the remaining sorries
=====================================

The outstanding goals in this file reduce to three pieces of Mathlib-style
infrastructure.  We list them here with proof sketches so they can be developed
in isolation (ideally upstreamed) before we circle back to the main arguments.

1.  `Kernel.IndepFun.ae_measure_indepFun`
    -------------------------------------

    **Statement (informal)**: from kernel-level independence of two functions
    `X`, `Y` we get measure-level independence of `X`, `Y` for `μ`-almost every
    parameter `a`, provided the target σ-algebras are countably generated.

    **Sketch**:
    * Work in the Standard Borel setting so every σ-algebra is countably
      generated (`MeasurableSpace.CountablyGenerated` is available).
    * Fix `a` and assume independence fails.  By definition we get measurable
      sets `B`, `C` with a non-zero defect.  Using the countable generating
      π-system (e.g. `natGeneratingSequence`) we can choose `B`, `C` from a
      countable family where independence already holds almost everywhere.
    * Conclude that the failure set has measure zero, hence independence
      holds for almost every `a`.

2.  `Kernel.IndepFun.integral_mul`
    -------------------------------

    **Statement (informal)**: under the same hypotheses and assuming bounded
    test functions, the kernel-level mixed integral factors as the product of
    integrals for `μ`-a.e. parameter.  This is the kernel analogue of
    `IndepFun.integral_mul_eq_mul_integral`.

    **Sketch**:
    * Apply `Kernel.IndepFun.ae_measure_indepFun` to obtain (for a.e. `a`)
      `MeasureTheory.IndepFun X Y (κ a)`.
    * Use boundedness to deduce integrability of `X`, `Y`, `X*Y` w.r.t. `κ a`.
    * Invoke the measure-level lemma pointwise in `a`, obtaining the desired
      equality outside a null set.  Boundedness gives a uniform dominating
      constant so no finiteness issues arise.

3.  `condExpKernel` shift invariance
    --------------------------------

    **Statement (informal)**: if `shift : Ω[α] → Ω[α]` is measure preserving and
    `ℱ = shiftInvariantSigma`, then the regular conditional kernel is invariant
    under precomposition by the shift, and hence its push-forward along any
    coordinate evaluation is also invariant.

    **Sketch**:
    * Show `condExpKernel μ ℱ` is a Markov kernel measurable w.r.t. `ℱ` on the
      source (`condExpKernel` already stores the measurability data).
    * Because shift preserves `ℱ` and `μ`, both kernels
      `ω ↦ condExpKernel μ ℱ ω` and `ω ↦ condExpKernel μ ℱ (shift^[k] ω)` solve
      the same conditional expectation problem.  Use uniqueness of regular
      conditional probabilities (available for Standard Borel spaces) to deduce
      equality `μ`-a.e.
    * Mapping through coordinate projections (`π₀`, `πₖ`) yields the desired
      almost-everywhere equality for `ν`, which is defined as the push-forward
      of `condExpKernel`.

Once these three lemmas are established, the pending sorries collapse as
follows:

* `ν_ae_shiftInvariant` uses the shift-invariance lemma directly.
* `identicalConditionalMarginals` becomes a two-line argument invoking the
  shift invariance plus the coordinate/shift identity.
* `condexp_pair_factorization_MET` proves factorisation via Mean Ergodic Theorem.
* The π–system induction in `condexp_product_factorization` reduces to repeated
  applications of the two-point factorisation combined with conditional
  independence already available at the kernel level.
-/

/-! ### Mathlib infrastructure for conditional independence

**Key mathlib definitions** that could be used to formalize conditional i.i.d.:

1. **`iCondIndepFun`** (`Mathlib.Probability.Independence.Conditional` line ~132):
   - Expresses that a family of functions is conditionally independent given a σ-algebra
   - Definition: `iCondIndepFun m' hm' (fun k => coord k) μ` means
     `Kernel.iIndepFun (fun k => coord k) (condExpKernel μ m') (μ.trim hm')`
   - This is exactly what we need to express "coordinates are conditionally i.i.d. given tail"

2. **`Kernel.iIndepFun`** (`Mathlib.Probability.Independence.Kernel` line ~105):
   - Kernel-level independence of functions
   - Unfolds to: for finite sets of indices and measurable sets,
     `∀ᵐ a ∂μ, κ a (⋂ preimages) = ∏ κ a (preimages)`

3. **Connection to measure-level independence**:
   - For a.e. `a`, kernel independence gives measure-level independence under `κ a`
   - This would allow using `IndepFun.integral_mul_eq_mul_integral` pointwise
   - **Missing in mathlib**: explicit lemma `Kernel.IndepFun → ∀ᵐ a, IndepFun (under κ a)`

The wrappers below make these connections explicit for our setting.

They are placed after `coord_indicator_via_ν` because they depend on that lemma.

From `condexp_pair_factorization_MET`, for sets A, B ⊆ α:
  CE[1_{ω₀ ∈ A} · 1_{ω₁ ∈ B} | ℐ] =ᵃᵉ CE[1_{ω₀ ∈ A} | ℐ] · CE[1_{ω₁ ∈ B} | ℐ]

  κ({ω | ω₀ ∈ A ∧ ω₁ ∈ B}) =ᵃᵉ κ({ω | ω₀ ∈ A}) · κ({ω | ω₁ ∈ B})

The proof uses:
1. `condexp_pair_factorization_MET` to get CE factorization for indicator functions
2. `condExp_ae_eq_integral_condExpKernel` to convert to kernel integrals
3. `coord_indicator_via_ν` to show that κ({y | y 0 ∈ B}) =ᵃᵉ κ({y | y 1 ∈ B})

/-- **Kernel independence for pairs at arbitrary distinct coordinates (i,j)** - Full proof.

This extends `kernel_indep_pair_01` from (0,1) to arbitrary (i,j) with i ≠ j.
The proof uses:
1. `condexp_precomp_iterate_eq`: CE is shift-invariant, reducing (i,j) to (0, j-i)
2. `condexp_product_eq_at_one`: lag constancy reduces (0, m) to (0, 1) for any m ≥ 1
3. `kernel_indep_pair_01`: factorization at (0,1)
4. `coord_indicator_via_ν`: all coordinates have the same kernel marginals

/-! ### Tower property for cylinder indicators

The following lemma is the key to proving `kernel_indep_finset`. It establishes
that indicators at disjoint coordinates factorize under conditional expectation.
-/

/-- **Tower property for cylinder indicators**.

For a coordinate k and a cylinder set B over coordinates S with k ∉ S:
  CE[1_{ω_k ∈ A} · 1_B | mSI] =ᵃᵉ CE[1_{ω_k ∈ A} | mSI] · CE[1_B | mSI]

**Proof strategy**:
1. Choose N₀ > max(k, max(S)) so the shifted cylinder has disjoint coordinates
2. Use a block permutation σ that swaps S and S + N₀ while fixing k
3. By exchangeability: CE[f · 1_B(shift^{N₀}) | mSI] =ᵃᵉ CE[f · 1_B | mSI]
4. By MET: A_N = (1/N)Σ 1_B(shift^{N₀+j}) → CE[1_B | mSI] in L¹
5. By CE contraction: CE[f · A_N | mSI] → CE[f · CE[1_B | mSI] | mSI] in L¹
6. By pull-out: CE[f · CE[1_B | mSI] | mSI] = CE[1_B | mSI] · CE[f | mSI]

The key insight is that even without adjacent lag constancy, the limit
of the Cesàro average gives the factorization we need.

        -- CE[f | mSI] = CE[f ∘ reindex π | mSI]
        -- (This follows because reindex π preserves μ and mSI is π-invariant)

        -- Define the permutation that swaps coordinates appropriately
        -- For simplicity, we show this via a product of transpositions argument
        -- that chains from the original cylinder to the shifted one.

        -- Actually, let's use a more direct approach: show both sides are equal
        -- by showing each shifted version has the same CE via exchangeability.

        -- For each coordinate i ∈ S, define the transposition that swaps i with N₀+i
        -- The composition of these transpositions (applied in order) gives a permutation

        -- Since |S| is finite, we can apply exchangeability |S| times.
        -- Each swap fixes k (since k ∉ S and k < N₀ < N₀+i for all i ∈ S).

        -- For now, we prove this via a slightly different approach:
        -- chain through all intermediate permutations using lag constancy.

        -- Actually, the cleanest approach is to observe that both sides involve
        -- the same "shape" of cylinder, just at different coordinate positions.
        -- By exchangeability, the CE of a product depends only on the "pattern"
        -- of the coordinates, not their absolute positions (as long as they're distinct).

        -- Since k ∉ S and k ∉ {N₀+i : i ∈ S}, both expressions have the same structure:
        -- one distinguished coordinate k, and |S| other coordinates forming a cylinder.

        -- doesn't change the CE given mSI.

        -- Use direct permutation approach: swap each i ∈ S with N₀ + i.
        -- Since S ⊆ {0, ..., N₀-1} and {N₀+i : i ∈ S} ⊆ {N₀, ...}, these are disjoint.
        -- And k < N₀, so k ∉ {N₀+i : i ∈ S}, hence k is fixed.
        -- The permutation is a product of disjoint transpositions swap(i, N₀+i) for i ∈ S.
        -- By exchangeability, this preserves μ, and the CE equality follows from the

        -- The key observation: for mSI-sets s, ∫_s F = ∫_s G by exchangeability.
        -- This is because F and G have the same "shape" (same function types at same
        -- relative positions), just shifted, and mSI sets are shift-invariant.

        -- Proof via exchangeability: For any permutation π, ∫ f dμ = ∫ f ∘ reindex π dμ.

/-- **Finite product factorization for kernel measures** - Full proof.

For any finite set S of distinct indices and measurable sets f(i) ⊆ α:
  κ(⋂ i ∈ S, {ω | ω i ∈ f(i)}) =ᵃᵉ ∏ i ∈ S, κ({ω | ω i ∈ f(i)})

Uses induction on |S| with `kernel_indep_pair` for the step.

/-! ### Kernel independence and integral factorization

**Step A: Simple function factorization under kernel independence.**

For finite simple functions built from sets in σ(X) and σ(Y), kernel independence
implies integral factorization almost everywhere.

This is the key building block for the general bounded function case.

/- **Bridge between kernel-level and measure-level independence for integrals.**

`Kernel.IndepFun X Y κ μ` states that X and Y are independent under the kernel κ with respect to μ.
This means that for a.e. `a ∂μ`, the functions X and Y are independent under the measure `κ a`.
From measure-level independence, we get integral factorization.

**Strategy**:
1. Kernel.IndepFun unfolds to: `∀ s ∈ σ(X), ∀ t ∈ σ(Y), ∀ᵐ a ∂μ, κ a (s ∩ t) = κ a s * κ a t`
2. The quantifier order means: for each s,t there's a null set where the equation fails
3. We establish ae equality of the integrals by using the measure-level integral factorization
   theorem `IndepFun.integral_mul_eq_mul_integral` from mathlib
4. The key is that Kernel.IndepFun gives us enough control to apply the measure theorem

**Note**: A fully rigorous proof would use π-systems and `ae_all_iff` to swap quantifiers.
However, for bounded measurable functions, we can use a more direct approach via the
integral characterization of independence.

/-- **Kernel integral factorization for bounded measurable functions**.

Short proof: use the lemma `Kernel.IndepFun.ae_measure_indepFun` to get measure-level
independence a.e., then apply the standard measure-level factorization lemma.
