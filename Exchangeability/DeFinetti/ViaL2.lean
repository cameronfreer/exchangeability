# de Finetti's Theorem via L² Contractability

**Kallenberg's "second proof"** of de Finetti's theorem using the elementary
L² contractability bound (Lemma 1.2). This is the **lightest-dependency proof**.

## Proof approach

Starting from a **contractable** sequence ξ:

1. Fix a bounded measurable function f ∈ L¹
2. Use Lemma 1.2 (L² contractability bound) and completeness of L¹:
   - Show ‖E_m ∑_{k=n+1}^{n+m} (f(ξ_{n+k}) - α_{k-1})‖₁² → 0
3. Extract limit α_∞ = lim_n α_n in L¹
4. Show α_n is a reverse martingale (subsequence convergence a.s.)
5. Use contractability + dominated convergence:
   - E[f(ξ_i); ∩I_k] = E[α_{k-1}; ∩I_k] → E[α_∞; ∩I_k]
6. Conclude α_n = E_n f(ξ_{n+1}) = ν^f a.s.
7. Complete using the common ending (monotone class argument)

## Main results

* `deFinetti_viaL2`: **Main theorem** - contractable implies conditionally i.i.d.
* `deFinetti`: **Canonical name** (alias for `deFinetti_viaL2`)

Supporting lemmas:
* `weighted_sums_converge_L1`: L² bound implies L¹ convergence
* `reverse_martingale_limit`: Tail-measurable limit via reverse martingale

Auxiliary results (in separate file):
* `CovarianceStructure.contractable_covariance_structure`: Uniform covariance structure

## Why this proof is default

✅ **Elementary** - Only uses basic L² space theory and Cauchy-Schwarz
✅ **Direct** - Proves convergence via explicit bounds
✅ **Quantitative** - Gives explicit rates of convergence
✅ **Lightest dependencies** - No ergodic theory required

## Step 1: L² bound is the key tool

Before tackling the quantitative L² estimates we record two basic consequences of
contractability: (1) all single coordinates share the same law, and (2) any pair
of coordinates has the same joint distribution as `(X 0, X 1)`.  These facts are
packaged below and will later feed into the uniform covariance statement.

/-- **All bivariate marginals have the same distribution in a contractable sequence.**

For a contractable sequence, every increasing pair `(i,j)` with `i < j` has the same
joint law as `(X 0, X 1)`. This follows from contractability by taking the two-point
subsequence `{i, j}`.

Combined with `contractable_map_single`, this establishes that covariances are uniform:
Cov(X_i, X_j) depends only on whether i = j, giving the covariance structure needed
for the L² contractability bound. -/

  -- - By contractability, these have uniform covariance structure (m, σ², ρ)
  -- - Equal weights: p_i = q_i = 1/k (different windows)
  -- - For different starting positions, one weight vector is for indices n+1..n+k,

  -- Strategy: The key observation is that comparing a long average (1/m) with
  -- a tail average (1/k over last k terms) is the same as comparing two different
  -- weight vectors over the same m terms.

  -- Since Cf is already the uniform bound for equal-weight windows (from hCf_unif),
  -- and this comparison uses weights that differ by at most 1/k at each position,
  -- the bound follows from the general weight lemma.

  -- Specifically:
  -- - Long avg: sum_{i<m} (1/m) f(X_{n+i+1})
  -- - Tail avg: sum_{i<k} (1/k) f(X_{n+(m-k)+i+1}) = sum_{i in [m-k,m)} (1/k) f(X_{n+i+1})
  -- These can be written as:
  --   p_i = 1/m for all i
  --   q_i = 0 for i < m-k, and 1/k for i >= m-k
  -- So sup|p-q| = max(1/m, 1/k) = 1/k (since k ≤ m)

  -- The bound from l2_contractability_bound would be: 2σ²(1-ρ) · (1/k) = Cf/k
  -- which is exactly what we need to prove.

  -- Direct approach using hCf_unif:
  -- The tail average is an equal-weight window of size k starting at n+(m-k):
  --   (1/k) ∑_{j<k} f(X_{n+(m-k)+j+1})
  --
  -- Strategy:
  -- 1. Use triangle inequality: |long_avg - tail_avg| ≤ |long_avg - some_window| + |some_window - tail_avg|
  -- 2. The tail window is exactly window starting at position n+(m-k)
  -- 3. Can compare it with a window of size k starting at n using hCf_unif
  -- 4. The bound Cf/k applies since both are equal-weight windows of size k
  --
  -- Rewrite long average (1/m) * ∑_{i<m} f(X_{n+i+1}) in terms of weights on each position
  -- We can split it as: sum over first (m-k) terms + sum over last k terms
  -- Then compare with the tail average which is just the last k terms weighted by 1/k

  -- Key insight: Write the difference as a weighted combination where we can apply sum_tail_block_reindex
  -- Long avg = (1/m) * [first (m-k) terms + last k terms]
  -- Tail avg = (1/k) * [last k terms]
  -- Difference involves the last k terms with weight (1/m - 1/k) and first terms with weight 1/m

  -- Since |1/m - 1/k| ≤ 1/k and we have at most m terms each bounded,
  -- this reduces to applying the uniform bound hCf_unif

  -- For now, use that the tail average starting at n+(m-k) is a window of size k,
  -- so we can bound it against another window of size k using hCf_unif

For a contractable sequence X and bounded measurable f, the Cesàro averages
`(1/m) * ∑_{i<m} f(X_{n+i+1})` converge in L¹ to a limit α : Ω → ℝ that does not depend on n.

This is the key convergence result needed for de Finetti's theorem via the L² approach.

## Step 3: Reverse martingale convergence
-/

/-- **FMP 4.2: Subsequence criterion**.

Let ξ, ξ₁, ξ₂,... be random elements in a metric space (S, ρ). Then ξₙ →ᵖ ξ
iff every subsequence N' ⊆ ℕ has a further subsequence N'' ⊆ N' such that
ξₙ → ξ a.s. along N''.
In particular, ξₙ → ξ a.s. implies ξₙ →ᵖ ξ.

**Proof outline** (Kallenberg):
Forward direction (→ᵖ implies a.s. along subsequence):
1. Assume ξₙ →ᵖ ξ, fix arbitrary subsequence N' ⊆ ℕ
2. Choose further subsequence N'' ⊆ N' with
   E ∑_{n∈N''} {ρ(ξₙ,ξ) ∧ 1} = ∑_{n∈N''} E[ρ(ξₙ,ξ) ∧ 1] < ∞
   (equality by monotone convergence)
3. Series converges a.s., so ξₙ → ξ a.s. along N''

Reverse direction (a.s. subsequences imply →ᵖ):
1. Assume condition. If ξₙ ↛ᵖ ξ, then ∃ε > 0 with E[ρ(ξₙ,ξ) ∧ 1] > ε along N' ⊆ ℕ
2. By hypothesis, ξₙ → ξ a.s. along N'' ⊆ N'
3. By dominated convergence, E[ρ(ξₙ,ξ) ∧ 1] → 0 along N'', contradiction

**Mathlib reference**: Look for convergence in probability and a.s. convergence
in `Probability` namespace. The subsequence extraction should follow from
summability of expectations.

the reverse martingale property follows immediately from the standard tower property

## Step 6: Build directing measure ν via Carathéodory extension

Given the family of limit functions α_f for bounded measurable f, we construct
the directing measure ν : Ω → Measure ℝ such that:
- ν(ω) is a probability measure for each ω
- ω ↦ ν(ω)(B) is measurable for each Borel B
- α_f(ω) = ∫ f dν(ω) for all bounded measurable f

The construction proceeds via the Carathéodory extension theorem:
1. For intervals (-∞, t], use α_{𝟙_{(-∞,t]}} to define a pre-measure
2. Verify this is a valid CDF (monotone, right-continuous, limits 0 and 1)
3. Extend to Borel sets via Carathéodory
4. Establish measurability of ω ↦ ν(ω)(B) using monotone class theorem

This is the "lightest path" mentioned in the original plan.

/-- For each ω, the map t ↦ α_{𝟙_{(-∞,t]}}(ω) defines a CDF.

## Infrastructure for directing measure construction (used by TheoremViaL2)

The following theorems provide the building blocks for constructing the directing
measure ν and verifying its properties. The actual completion via CommonEnding
happens in TheoremViaL2.lean to maintain proper import separation.
-/

/-- **L² convergence establishes directing measure requirements**.

This theorem packages the L² approach infrastructure, showing that for a contractable
sequence with L² bounds, we can construct a directing measure ν that satisfies all
the requirements needed for the CommonEnding completion.

**What this provides**:
- Existence of directing measure ν via `directing_measure`
- ν(ω) is a probability measure
- ω ↦ ν(ω)(B) is measurable for Borel B
- Bridge property: E[∏ᵢ 𝟙_{Bᵢ}(X_{k(i)})] = E[∏ᵢ ν(·)(Bᵢ)]

**What remains**: Applying `CommonEnding.complete_from_directing_measure` to get
ConditionallyIID. This happens in TheoremViaL2.lean.
