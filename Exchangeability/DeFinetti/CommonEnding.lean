# Common Ending for de Finetti Proofs

This file contains the common final step shared by Kallenberg's First and Second proofs
of de Finetti's theorem. Both proofs construct a directing measure ν and then use
the same argument to establish the conditional i.i.d. property.

## The common structure

Given:
- A contractable/exchangeable sequence ξ
- A directing measure ν (constructed differently in each proof)
- The property that E[f(ξ_i) | ℱ] = ν^f for bounded measurable f

Show:
- ξ is conditionally i.i.d. given the tail σ-algebra

## Integration with Mathlib

This file uses several key mathlib components:
- `Measure.pi`: Finite product measures from `Mathlib.MeasureTheory.Constructions.Pi`
- `Kernel`: Probability kernels from `Mathlib.Probability.Kernel.Basic`
- `MeasureSpace.induction_on_inter`: π-λ theorem from `Mathlib.MeasureTheory.PiSystem`
- `Ergodic`, `MeasurePreserving`: From `Mathlib.Dynamics.Ergodic.Ergodic`
- `condExp`: Conditional expectation from `Mathlib.MeasureTheory.Function.ConditionalExpectation.Basic`

See also `Exchangeability.ConditionallyIID` for the definition of conditionally i.i.d. sequences
using mathlib's measure theory infrastructure.

## Tail σ-algebras and Invariant σ-fields

For an exchangeable or contractable sequence X : ℕ → Ω → α, the **tail σ-algebra** consists
of events that depend only on the "tail" of the sequence, i.e., events invariant under
modifications of finitely many coordinates.

Following Kallenberg (FMP 10.2-10.4):
- A set I is **invariant** under a transformation T if T⁻¹I = I
- A set I is **almost invariant** if μ(I Δ T⁻¹I) = 0
- The collection of invariant sets forms the **invariant σ-field** ℐ
- The collection of almost invariant sets forms the **almost invariant σ-field** ℐ'
- **Key result (FMP 10.4)**: ℐ' = ℐ^μ (the μ-completion of ℐ)

For exchangeable sequences:
- The shift operator T: (ℕ → α) → (ℕ → α) by (Tξ)(n) = ξ(n+1) is the natural transformation
- The tail σ-algebra is related to the shift-invariant σ-field
- A function f is tail-measurable iff it's measurable w.r.t. the tail σ-algebra
- **FMP 10.3**: f is invariant/almost invariant iff f is ℐ-measurable/ℐ^μ-measurable

The directing measure ν constructed in de Finetti proofs is tail-measurable (almost invariant).
This is essential for showing that ν defines a proper conditional kernel.

TODO: Formalize tail σ-algebra for sequences and prove it equals the shift-invariant σ-field.

/-- **FMP 10.3 (Invariant sets and functions)**: A measurable function f is invariant
(f ∘ shift = f) if and only if it is measurable with respect to the invariant σ-field.

This is the key connection between syntactic invariance and σ-field measurability.

Proof strategy (following Kallenberg FMP 10.3):
1. (⇒) Assume f ∘ shift = f
   - Need to show f is measurable w.r.t. invariantSigmaField α
   - The invariant σ-field is defined as MeasurableSpace.comap shift inferInstance
   - A function g is measurable w.r.t. comap shift iff g ∘ shift⁻¹ is measurable
   - Since f is shift-invariant: f = f ∘ shift ∘ shift⁻¹ (where shift⁻¹ exists on range)
   - This gives the required measurability

2. (⇐) Assume f is measurable w.r.t. invariantSigmaField α
   - By definition of comap, f⁻¹(B) ∈ invariantSigmaField for all measurable B
   - This means shift⁻¹(f⁻¹(B)) = f⁻¹(B)
   - Equivalently: (f ∘ shift)⁻¹(B) = f⁻¹(B) for all measurable B
   - Since β is countably generated, this implies f ∘ shift = f almost everywhere
   - For deterministic functions on ℕ → α, a.e. equality is actual equality

The proof requires careful handling of the comap construction and the countably
generated assumption to move from set-level equality to function equality.

/-- For a probability measure μ on path space, a function is **almost tail-measurable**
if it differs from a tail-measurable function on a μ-null set.
By FMP 10.4, this is equivalent to measurability w.r.t. the μ-completion of the invariant σ-field.

/-- **Connection to Exchangeability**: For an exchangeable sequence X : ℕ → Ω → α,
the path-space measure μ_X (push-forward of the base measure μ by ω ↦ (X n ω)_{n ∈ ℕ})
is invariant under the shift operator. More generally, μ_X is invariant under all
finite permutations.

This invariance is why the tail σ-algebra (shift-invariant σ-field) is the natural
conditioning σ-field for de Finetti's theorem:
- The directing measure ν must be tail-measurable (FMP 10.3-10.4)
- Conditional expectations with respect to the tail σ-algebra give the mixing measure
- The tail σ-field is trivial for ergodic measures (0-1 law)

Proof strategy:
1. Define path-space measure: μ_X = Measure.map (fun ω n => X n ω) μ
2. Show shift is measurable: shift : (ℕ → α) → (ℕ → α) is measurable
3. Prove measure-preserving property:
   - For any measurable B ⊆ (ℕ → α), need: μ_X(shift⁻¹(B)) = μ_X(B)
   - Since X is exchangeable, finite permutations preserve the distribution
   - The shift is the limit of finite permutations (shift by 1)
   - For exchangeable sequences, the distribution is invariant under all permutations
   - In particular: μ_X{paths | shift(path) ∈ B} = μ_X(B)

4. The key insight: exchangeability = invariance under finite coordinate swaps
   - Shift can be approximated by swapping coordinates 0↔1, 1↔2, 2↔3, ...
   - Each swap preserves the distribution by exchangeability
   - The limit preserves the distribution by continuity of measures

This connects the combinatorial property (exchangeability) to the dynamical
property (shift-invariance), which is the bridge to ergodic theory.

/-- **Key Bridge Lemma**: If E[f(X_i) | tail] = ∫ f dν for all bounded measurable f,
then for indicator functions we get E[𝟙_B(X_i) | tail] = ν(B).

This is the crucial step connecting the abstract conditional expectation property
to concrete probability statements about measurable sets.

Proof outline:
1. The indicator function 𝟙_B : α → ℝ is bounded (by 1) and measurable
2. By hypothesis hν_cond, we have: E[𝟙_B(Xᵢ) | tail] = ∫ 𝟙_B d(ν ω)
3. The RHS simplifies: ∫ 𝟙_B d(ν ω) = ν(ω)(B) (by definition of indicator integral)
4. The LHS is exactly what we want: E[𝟙_B(Xᵢ) | tail](ω)
5. Converting to ℝ gives: (ν ω B).toReal

/-- Helper lemma: The integral of the product of bounded functions equals the product
of their integrals when integrating against a product measure. This is a key step in
showing conditional independence.

This is a Fubini-type theorem for product measures. The general strategy:
- For two variables: ∫ f(x,y) d(μ × ν) = ∫ (∫ f(x,y) dν(y)) dμ(x)
- For products of functions: ∫ (f₁(x₁) · f₂(x₂)) = (∫ f₁) · (∫ f₂) by independence
- Extend to finite products by induction

In mathlib, relevant lemmas include:
- `MeasureTheory.lintegral_prod` for Lebesgue integration on product spaces
- Fubini theorem variants in `Mathlib.MeasureTheory.Constructions.Prod`
- Product measure characterization in `Mathlib.MeasureTheory.Constructions.Pi`

The key challenge is that we need this for regular integral (∫) over ℝ-valued functions,
not just lintegral (∫⁻) over ENNReal-valued functions. This requires:
1. Measurability conditions (handled by hf)
2. Integrability conditions (would need boundedness or L¹ assumptions)
3. Careful use of product measure Fubini theorems from mathlib

  -- The detailed proof would use mathlib's Fubini theorem for finite products
  -- and induction over Fintype ι
  sorry  -- TODO: Implement using mathlib's product measure Fubini theorems

/-- For conditionally i.i.d. sequences, the joint distribution of finitely many coordinates
equals the average of the product measures built from the directing measure.

This is an intermediate result showing how the finite-dimensional distributions are determined
by the directing measure ν.

Note: We use lintegral (∫⁻) for measure-valued integrals since measures are ENNReal-valued.

Proof strategy:
1. Start from hν_dir: E[f(Xᵢ) | tail] = ∫ f d(ν ω) for bounded measurable f
2. Apply to indicator functions: E[𝟙_Bᵢ(Xᵢ)] = E[ν(Bᵢ)]
3. Use conditional independence to get products:
   E[∏ᵢ 𝟙_Bᵢ(Xᵢ)] = E[∏ᵢ ν(Bᵢ)]
4. The LHS = μ{ω : ∀i, Xᵢ(ω) ∈ Bᵢ} (by definition of product of indicators)
5. The RHS = ∫⁻ ω, ∏ᵢ ν(Bᵢ)(ω) dμ = ∫⁻ ω, (Measure.pi ν)(B) dμ
   where B = {x : ∀i, xᵢ ∈ Bᵢ} is the product set

The key step (3) requires proving conditional independence, which comes from
the monotone class argument extending from bounded functions to product sets.

This is a fundamental result in product measure theory: the σ-algebra on a finite
product equals the σ-algebra generated by measurable rectangles.

Proof strategy:
- The product σ-algebra is the smallest σ-algebra making all projections measurable
- A set is in this σ-algebra iff it's in the σ-algebra generated by cylinder sets
- Cylinder sets are finite intersections of preimages of projections
- These are exactly the rectangles

In mathlib, this should follow from the definition of Pi.measurableSpace and
properties of generateFrom.

/-- Helper: Product measures are measurable as a function of their components.
This states that if ω ↦ ν ω is a measurable family of measures, then
ω ↦ Measure.pi (fun _ => ν ω) is also measurable.

This is a technical lemma needed for product measure kernels. The proof should use:
1. A measure is determined by its values on a π-system generating the σ-algebra
2. For product measures, measurable rectangles form such a π-system
3. The product measure of a rectangle ∏ Bᵢ equals ∏ ν(Bᵢ)
4. Products of measurable functions are measurable
5. This gives measurability on the generating π-system, which extends to all measurable sets

In mathlib, this might follow from `Kernel.measurable` applied to the product kernel,
or from general results about measurability of measure-valued maps.

## The common completion argument

Kallenberg's text says: "The proof can now be completed as before."

This refers to the final step of the first proof, which goes:
1. Have directing measure ν with E[f(ξ_i) | ℱ] = ν^f
2. Use monotone class argument to extend to product sets
3. Show P[∩ Bᵢ | ℱ] = ν^k B for B ∈ 𝒮^k

### Proof Strategy Overview

The key insight is to connect three equivalent characterizations of conditional i.i.d.:

**A. Bounded Functions** (what we have from ergodic theory):
   For all bounded measurable f and all i:
   E[f(Xᵢ) | tail] = ∫ f d(ν ω) almost everywhere

**B. Indicator Functions** (intermediate step):
   For all measurable sets B and all i:
   E[𝟙_B(Xᵢ) | tail] = ν(B) almost everywhere

**C. Product Sets** (what we need for ConditionallyIID):
   For all m, k, and measurable rectangles B₀ × ... × Bₘ₋₁:
   μ{ω : ∀ i < m, X_{kᵢ}(ω) ∈ Bᵢ} = ∫ ∏ᵢ ν(Bᵢ) dμ

The progression:
- **A → B**: Apply A to indicator functions (they're bounded)
- **B → C**: Use product structure and independence
  - ∏ᵢ 𝟙_{Bᵢ}(Xᵢ) = 𝟙_{B₀×...×Bₘ₋₁}(X₀,...,Xₘ₋₁)
  - E[∏ᵢ 𝟙_{Bᵢ}(Xᵢ)] = ∏ᵢ E[𝟙_{Bᵢ}(Xᵢ)] = ∏ᵢ ν(Bᵢ) (conditional independence!)
- **C → ConditionallyIID**: π-λ theorem
  - Rectangles form a π-system generating the product σ-algebra
  - Both `Measure.map` and `μ.bind (Measure.pi ν)` agree on rectangles
  - By uniqueness of measure extension, they're equal everywhere

This modular structure makes each step verifiable and connects to standard measure theory results.
-/

/-- Given a sequence and a directing measure satisfying the key property
`E[f (ξᵢ) ∣ ℱ] = ν^f` for bounded measurable functions, we can establish
conditional independence.

This is the "completed As before" step referenced in the Second proof.

Outline (to be implemented):

  • **From directing measure to conditional kernels**: build the kernel
    `K : Kernel Ω α` given by `ω ↦ ν ω`, verifying tail measurability using
    FMP 10.3/10.4 (almost invariant σ-fields).
  • **Recover conditional i.i.d.**: for bounded measurable `f`, use the
    hypothesis to show that `E[f (Xᵢ) ∣ tail] = ∫ f d(K ω)`.
  • **Invoke `exchangeable_of_conditionallyIID`** (see
    `Exchangeability/ConditionallyIID.lean`) once the `conditionallyIID` record
    is built from `K`. That lemma already yields exchangeability; combining it
    with the converse direction gives conditional independence.
  • **Monotone class / π-λ argument**: extend equality from bounded measurable
    functions to cylinder sets, finishing the conditional independence proof.

The implementation will mirror Kallenberg's argument but reframed so this common
lemma serves both the Koopman and L² approaches.

**Proof outline** (Kallenberg):

2. Show 𝒟 is a π-system (then it's a σ-field)
3. Two-step extension:

   - Fix A ∈ 𝒟, define ℬ_A = {B : A ∩ B ∈ 𝒟}, show ℬ_A is λ-system ⊇ 𝒞

Mathlib's version is stated as an induction principle: if a predicate C holds on:
- The empty set
- All sets in the π-system 𝒞
- Is closed under complements
- Is closed under countable disjoint unions

Then C holds on all measurable sets in σ(𝒞).

✅ **Completed `rectangles_isPiSystem`**: Full proof that rectangles form π-system
✅ **Completed `shift_measurable`**: Full proof that shift operator is measurable
✅ **Added `rectangles_generate_pi_sigma`**: Structure for σ-algebra generation (1 sorry)
✅ **Expanded probability measure proofs**: Structured with clear dependencies (4 sorries)
✅ **Converted axioms to lemmas**: All major helper axioms now have proof outlines

**High Priority - Core Proof Steps:**
1. **Fill main sorry in `conditional_iid_from_directing_measure`** (line ~493):
   - Apply `fidi_eq_avg_product` to get equality on rectangles
   - Use `measure_eq_of_agree_on_pi_system` to extend to all measurable sets
   - This completes the core theorem

2. **Complete `fidi_eq_avg_product` proof** (lines 312-340):
   - Step 1: LHS as indicator product integral (sorry at line 317)
   - Step 2: Apply `condExp_indicator_eq_measure` for each coordinate
   - Step 3: Use conditional independence via monotone class (sorry at line 331)
   - Step 4: Recognize RHS as product measure (sorry at line 337)

**Medium Priority - Supporting Infrastructure:**
3. **Complete `integral_prod_eq_prod_integral` proof** (line 301):
   - Add boundedness hypothesis `hf_bdd`
   - Use mathlib's Fubini for product measures
   - Induction over finite index set

4. **Resolve `condExp_indicator_eq_measure` type issues** (line 267):
   - Currently returns `True` due to σ-field mismatch
   - Need proper pullback of tail σ-field from path space to base space Ω
   - Critical for connecting ergodic theory construction to conditional i.i.d.

5. **Prove/find `aemeasurable_measure_pi`** (axiom at line 339):
   - This is the technical AE-measurability requirement for product measures
   - Likely exists in mathlib or is straightforward from measurability of components

**Lower Priority - Infrastructure:**
6. **Tail σ-algebra formalization**:
   - Define proper tail σ-algebra as ⋂ n, σ(X_{n+1}, X_{n+2}, ...)
   - Prove equivalence with shift-invariant σ-field (FMP 10.3-10.4)
   - Show directing measure ν is tail-measurable

7. **Improve monotone_class_product_extension**: Complete the proof sketch
8. **Add more examples and documentation**: Help future users understand the flow

### Current Status

The file provides a **complete proof architecture** for deriving conditional i.i.d. from a
directing measure. All major steps are:
- ✅ **Identified and documented** with clear roadmaps
- ✅ **Structured modularly** so each piece can be completed independently
- ✅ **Connected to standard tools** (π-λ theorem, measure uniqueness, Fubini)
- ⚠️  **Not yet executed** - main proofs still contain `sorry` or `axiom`

The design separates **infrastructure** (this file) from **construction** (Koopman/L² files),
allowing both approaches to share the final completion argument. This matches Kallenberg's
presentation where both proofs say "The proof can now be completed as before."

Next steps: Start with High Priority items, replacing axioms with actual mathlib lemmas and
filling in the main proof using the helper functions we've established.
