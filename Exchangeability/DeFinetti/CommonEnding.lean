# Common Ending for de Finetti Proofs

This file contains the common final step shared by Kallenberg's First and Second proofs
of de Finetti's theorem. Both proofs construct a directing measure ν and then use
the same argument to establish the conditional i.i.d. property.

## The common structure

Given:
- A contractable/exchangeable sequence ξ
- A directing measure ν (constructed differently in each proof)
- The property that E[f(ξ_i) | ℱ] = ν^f for bounded measurable f

Show:
- ξ is conditionally i.i.d. given the tail σ-algebra

## Integration with Mathlib

This file uses several key mathlib components:
- `Measure.pi`: Finite product measures from `Mathlib.MeasureTheory.Constructions.Pi`
- `Kernel`: Probability kernels from `Mathlib.Probability.Kernel.Basic`
- `MeasureSpace.induction_on_inter`: π-λ theorem from `Mathlib.MeasureTheory.PiSystem`
- `Ergodic`, `MeasurePreserving`: From `Mathlib.Dynamics.Ergodic.Ergodic`
- `condExp`: Conditional expectation from
  `Mathlib.MeasureTheory.Function.ConditionalExpectation.Basic`

See also `Exchangeability.ConditionallyIID` for the definition of conditionally i.i.d. sequences
using mathlib's measure theory infrastructure.

## Tail σ-algebras and Invariant σ-fields

For an exchangeable or contractable sequence X : ℕ → Ω → α, the **tail σ-algebra** consists
of events that depend only on the "tail" of the sequence, i.e., events invariant under
modifications of finitely many coordinates.

Following Kallenberg (FMP 10.2-10.4):
- A set I is **invariant** under a transformation T if T⁻¹I = I
- A set I is **almost invariant** if μ(I Δ T⁻¹I) = 0
- The collection of invariant sets forms the **invariant σ-field** ℐ
- The collection of almost invariant sets forms the **almost invariant σ-field** ℐ'
- **Key result (FMP 10.4)**: ℐ' = ℐ^μ (the μ-completion of ℐ)

For exchangeable sequences:
- The shift operator T: (ℕ → α) → (ℕ → α) by (Tξ)(n) = ξ(n+1) is the natural
  transformation
- The tail σ-algebra is related to the shift-invariant σ-field
- A function f is tail-measurable iff it's measurable w.r.t. the tail σ-algebra
- **FMP 10.3**: f is invariant/almost invariant iff f is ℐ-measurable/ℐ^μ-measurable

The directing measure ν constructed in de Finetti proofs is tail-measurable (almost invariant).
This is essential for showing that ν defines a proper conditional kernel.

Note: Formalizing tail σ-algebra equality with shift-invariant σ-field is future work.

/- ### Key Bridge Lemma
If `E[f(Xᵢ) | tail] = ∫ f dν` for all bounded measurable `f`, then for indicator functions
we get `E[𝟙_B(Xᵢ) | tail] = ν(B)`.  This intuition underlies the hypothesis `h_bridge` used
below.
-/

/-- For conditionally i.i.d. sequences, the joint distribution of finitely many coordinates
equals the average of the product measures built from the directing measure.

This is an intermediate result showing how the finite-dimensional distributions are determined
by the directing measure `ν`.

Note: We use lintegral (∫⁻) for measure-valued integrals since measures are `ENNReal`-valued.

Proof strategy:
1. Postulate the bridging identity `h_bridge` for indicators: the integral of the
   product of coordinate indicators equals the integral of the product of the
   conditional marginals
2. Interpret the indicator product as the indicator of the event and rewrite the
   right-hand side using product measures
4. The LHS is `μ {ω | ∀ i, Xᵢ(ω) ∈ Bᵢ}`; the RHS is the integral of the product measure
5. From these, we obtain the desired equality on rectangles

The missing ingredient is the `h_bridge` identity, which is supplied later from the
directing-measure construction.

## The common completion argument

Kallenberg's text says: "The proof can now be completed as before."

This refers to the final step of the first proof, which goes:
1. Have directing measure ν with E[f(ξ_i) | ℱ] = ν^f
2. Use monotone class argument to extend to product sets
3. Show P[∩ Bᵢ | ℱ] = ν^k B for B ∈ 𝒮^k

### Proof Strategy Overview

The key insight is to connect three equivalent characterizations of conditional i.i.d.:

**A. Bounded Functions** (what we have from ergodic theory):
   For all bounded measurable f and all i:
   E[f(Xᵢ) | tail] = ∫ f d(ν ω) almost everywhere

**B. Indicator Functions** (intermediate step):
   For all measurable sets B and all i:
   E[𝟙_B(Xᵢ) | tail] = ν(B) almost everywhere

**C. Product Sets** (what we need for ConditionallyIID):
   For all m, k, and measurable rectangles B₀ × ... × Bₘ₋₁:
   μ{ω : ∀ i < m, X_{kᵢ}(ω) ∈ Bᵢ} = ∫ ∏ᵢ ν(Bᵢ) dμ

The progression:
- **A → B**: Apply A to indicator functions (they're bounded)
- **B → C**: Use product structure and independence
  - ∏ᵢ 𝟙_{Bᵢ}(Xᵢ) = 𝟙_{B₀×...×Bₘ₋₁}(X₀,...,Xₘ₋₁)
  - E[∏ᵢ 𝟙_{Bᵢ}(Xᵢ)] = ∏ᵢ E[𝟙_{Bᵢ}(Xᵢ)] = ∏ᵢ ν(Bᵢ)
    (conditional independence!)
- **C → ConditionallyIID**: π-λ theorem
  - Rectangles form a π-system generating the product σ-algebra
  - Both `Measure.map` and `μ.bind (Measure.pi ν)` agree on rectangles
  - By uniqueness of measure extension, they're equal everywhere

This modular structure makes each step verifiable and connects to standard measure theory results.
-/

/-- Given a sequence and a directing measure satisfying the key property
`E[f (ξᵢ) ∣ ℱ] = ν^f` for bounded measurable functions, we can establish
conditional independence.

This is the "completed As before" step referenced in the Second proof.

Outline (to be implemented):

  • **From directing measure to conditional kernels**: build the kernel
    `K : Kernel Ω α` given by `ω ↦ ν ω`, verifying tail measurability using
    FMP 10.3/10.4 (almost invariant σ-fields).
  • **Recover conditional i.i.d.**: for bounded measurable `f`, use the
    hypothesis to show that `E[f (Xᵢ) ∣ tail] = ∫ f d(K ω)`.
  • **Invoke `exchangeable_of_conditionallyIID`** (see
    `Exchangeability/ConditionallyIID.lean`) once the `conditionallyIID` record
    is built from `K`. That lemma already yields exchangeability; combining it
    with the converse direction gives conditional independence.
  • **Monotone class / π-λ argument**: extend equality from bounded measurable
    functions to cylinder sets, finishing the conditional independence proof.

The implementation will mirror Kallenberg's argument but reframed so this common
lemma serves both the Koopman and L² approaches.

/-- **FMP 1.1: Monotone Class Theorem (Sierpiński)** = Dynkin's π-λ theorem.

Let 𝒞 be a π-system and 𝒟 a λ-system in some space Ω such that 𝒞 ⊆ 𝒟.
Then σ(𝒞) ⊆ 𝒟.

**Proof outline** (Kallenberg):
1. Assume 𝒟 = λ(𝒞) (smallest λ-system containing 𝒞)
2. Show 𝒟 is a π-system (then it's a σ-field)
3. Two-step extension:
   - Fix B ∈ 𝒞, define 𝒜_B = {A : A ∩ B ∈ 𝒟}, show 𝒜_B is λ-system ⊇ 𝒞
   - Fix A ∈ 𝒟, define ℬ_A = {B : A ∩ B ∈ 𝒟}, show ℬ_A is λ-system ⊇ 𝒞

**Mathlib version**: `MeasurableSpace.induction_on_inter`

Mathlib's version is stated as an induction principle: if a predicate C holds on:
- The empty set
- All sets in the π-system 𝒞
- Is closed under complements
- Is closed under countable disjoint unions

Then C holds on all measurable sets in σ(𝒞).

**Definitions in mathlib**:
- `IsPiSystem`: A collection closed under binary non-empty intersections
  (Mathlib/MeasureTheory/PiSystem.lean)
- `DynkinSystem`: A structure containing ∅, closed under complements and
  countable disjoint unions (Mathlib/MeasureTheory/PiSystem.lean)
- `induction_on_inter`: The π-λ theorem as an induction principle
  (Mathlib/MeasureTheory/PiSystem.lean)

This theorem is now a direct wrapper around mathlib's `induction_on_inter`.

/-- Package the common ending as a reusable theorem.

Given a contractable sequence and a directing measure ν constructed via
either approach (Mean Ergodic Theorem or L² bound), this completes the
proof to conditional i.i.d.

This encapsulates the "completed as before" step.
