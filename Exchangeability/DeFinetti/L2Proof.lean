# De Finetti's Theorem via L² Contractability (Kallenberg's Second Proof)

This file implements Kallenberg's "Second proof" of de Finetti's Theorem 1.1,
which uses the elementary L² contractability bound (Lemma 1.2) combined with
reverse martingale convergence.

## Kallenberg's Second Proof Structure

Starting from a **contractable** sequence ξ:

1. Fix a bounded measurable function f ∈ L¹
2. Use Lemma 1.2 (L² bound) and completeness of L¹ to show:
   ‖E_m ∑_{k=n+1}^{n+m} (f(ξ_{n+k}) - α_{k-1})‖₁² → 0
3. Extract limit α_∞ = lim_n α_n in L¹
4. Show α_n is a reverse martingale (subsequence convergence a.s.)
5. Use contractability + dominated convergence:
   E[f(ξ_i); ∩I_k] = E[α_{k-1}; ∩I_k] → E[α_∞; ∩I_k]
6. Conclude α_n = E_n f(ξ_{n+1}) = ν^f a.s.
7. Complete using the common ending (monotone class argument)

## Step 1: L² bound is the key tool

We don't actually need the full covariance structure. The L² contractability bound
from `L2Approach.lean` (Lemma 1.2) is sufficient for showing Cauchy convergence
of the empirical averages.

The contractable_covariance_structure lemma below is postponed as it's not needed
for the main proof.
-/

/-- For a contractable sequence of real-valued random variables in L², all pairs
have the same covariance. This follows from contractability implying that all
increasing subsequences of length 2 have the same joint distribution.

NOTE: This lemma is not needed for the main proof and is left for future work.

## Step 2: L² bound implies L¹ convergence of weighted sums (Kallenberg's key step)
-/

/-- **L² bound wrapper for two starting windows**.

For contractable sequences, the L² difference between averages starting at different
indices n and m is uniformly small. This gives us the key uniform bound we need.

Using `l2_contractability_bound` with appropriate weights shows that for large windows,
the starting index doesn't matter.

         -- The weights are p_i = 1/k for i ≤ k (starting at n+1)
         -- and q_i = 1/k for i ≤ k (starting at m+1)
         -- The sup |p_i - q_i| for shifted indices gives the bound

/-- For a contractable sequence and bounded measurable f, the weighted sums
(1/m) ∑_{k=n+1}^{n+m} f(ξ_{n+k}) converge to a **single** function α (independent of n).

This is Kallenberg's key application of the L² bound (Lemma 1.2).

**Key insight**: Using the uniform two-window bound, we show that the limit α_n is
actually **independent of n**. For any n, m and large window k:
  ‖α_n - α_m‖₁ ≤ ‖α_n - A n k‖₁ + ‖A n k - A m k‖₂ + ‖A m k - α_m‖₁
where the middle term is bounded by O(1/k) uniformly in n,m by `l2_bound_two_windows`.

This eliminates the 3ε uniformity problem!

## Step 3: Reverse martingale convergence
-/

/-- **FMP 4.2: Subsequence criterion**.

Let ξ, ξ₁, ξ₂,... be random elements in a metric space (S, ρ). Then ξₙ →ᵖ ξ
iff every subsequence N' ⊆ ℕ has a further subsequence N'' ⊆ N' such that ξₙ → ξ a.s. along N''.
In particular, ξₙ → ξ a.s. implies ξₙ →ᵖ ξ.

**Proof outline** (Kallenberg):
Forward direction (→ᵖ implies a.s. along subsequence):
1. Assume ξₙ →ᵖ ξ, fix arbitrary subsequence N' ⊆ ℕ
2. Choose further subsequence N'' ⊆ N' with
   E ∑_{n∈N''} {ρ(ξₙ,ξ) ∧ 1} = ∑_{n∈N''} E[ρ(ξₙ,ξ) ∧ 1] < ∞
   (equality by monotone convergence)
3. Series converges a.s., so ξₙ → ξ a.s. along N''

Reverse direction (a.s. subsequences imply →ᵖ):
1. Assume condition. If ξₙ ↛ᵖ ξ, then ∃ε > 0 with E[ρ(ξₙ,ξ) ∧ 1] > ε along N' ⊆ ℕ
2. By hypothesis, ξₙ → ξ a.s. along N'' ⊆ N'
3. By dominated convergence, E[ρ(ξₙ,ξ) ∧ 1] → 0 along N'', contradiction

**Mathlib reference**: Look for convergence in probability and a.s. convergence
in `Probability` namespace. The subsequence extraction should follow from
summability of expectations.

the reverse martingale property follows immediately from the standard tower property
of conditional expectation.

For now, we state this as `True` and complete the identification in Step 5.
