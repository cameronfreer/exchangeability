# Third proof of de Finetti via a martingale argument (Aldous)

This file contains Aldous's elegant martingale proof of de Finetti's theorem, as
presented in Kallenberg (2005), Section 1.2.

## Main results

* `contraction_independence`: If `(ξ, η) =^d (ξ, ζ)` and `σ(η) ⊆ σ(ζ)`, then
  `ξ ⊥⊥_η ζ` (Lemma 1.3 in Kallenberg).
  
  **Proof idea:** For any measurable set `B`, define
  `μ₁ = P[ξ ∈ B | η]` and `μ₂ = P[ξ ∈ B | ζ]`.
  Then `(μ₁, μ₂)` is a bounded martingale with `μ₁ =^d μ₂`, so
  `E(μ₂ - μ₁)² = Eμ₂² - Eμ₁² = 0`, implying `μ₁ = μ₂` a.s.
  By Doob's characterization (FMP 6.6), this gives conditional independence.

* `deFinetti_martingale`: If `ξ` is contractable, then the `ξₙ` are conditionally
  i.i.d. given the tail σ-algebra `𝒯_ξ = ⋂_n σ(θ_n ξ)`.
  
  **Proof idea:** From contractability, `(ξ_m, θ_m ξ) =^d (ξ_k, θ_k ξ)` for `k ≤ m`.
  Using the contraction-independence lemma and reverse martingale convergence:
  ```
  P[ξ_m ∈ B | θ_m ξ] = P[ξ_k ∈ B | θ_m ξ] → P[ξ_k ∈ B | 𝒯_ξ]
  ```
  This shows:
  - `P[ξ_m ∈ B | θ_m ξ] = P[ξ_m ∈ B | 𝒯_ξ]`, giving `ξ_m ⊥⊥_{𝒯_ξ} θ_m ξ`
  - By iteration, `ξ₁, ξ₂, ...` are conditionally independent given `𝒯_ξ`
  - `P[ξ_m ∈ B | 𝒯_ξ] = P[ξ₁ ∈ B | 𝒯_ξ]`, showing identical conditional laws

/-- **Lemma 1.3 (contraction and independence).**

If `(ξ, η) =^d (ξ, ζ)` and `σ(η) ⊆ σ(ζ)`, then `ξ ⊥⊥_η ζ`.

**Proof sketch:** Fix a measurable set `B` and define:
- `μ₁ = P[ξ ∈ B | η]`
- `μ₂ = P[ξ ∈ B | ζ]`

Since `σ(η) ⊆ σ(ζ)`, we have that `μ₁` is `σ(η)`-measurable and `μ₂` is `σ(ζ)`-measurable,
making `(μ₁, μ₂)` a bounded martingale. From the distributional equality
`(ξ, η) =^d (ξ, ζ)`, we get `μ₁ =^d μ₂`, so:

```
E(μ₂ - μ₁)² = E μ₂² - E μ₁² = 0
```

Thus `μ₁ = μ₂` a.s., i.e., `P[ξ ∈ B | η] = P[ξ ∈ B | ζ]` a.s. By Doob's
characterization of conditional independence (FMP 6.6), this gives `ξ ⊥⊥_η ζ`. ∎

/-- Helper lemma: contractability gives the key distributional equality.

If `X` is contractable, then for any `k ≤ m`:
```
(X_m, θ_m X) =^d (X_k, θ_m X)
```
where `θ_m X` denotes the shifted process `n ↦ X(m + n)`. -/

  -- This proof is currently incomplete and requires additional machinery
  -- relating (co)products of measures to contractability.
  -- The key idea is that contractability says:
  --   For indices k < m < m+1 < m+2 < ...
  --   The joint distribution of (X k, X (m+1), X (m+2), ...)
  --   equals the distribution of (X m, X (m+1), X (m+2), ...)
  -- which is exactly saying (X_k, θ_m X) =^d (X_m, θ_m X).

  -- To prove this formally requires working with infinite products and

/-- **Key convergence result:** The extreme members agree after conditioning on the tail σ-algebra.

For any `k ≤ m` and measurable set `B`:
```
P[X_m ∈ B | θ_m X] = P[X_k ∈ B | θ_m X] → P[X_k ∈ B | 𝒯_X]  (as n → ∞)
```

This is proved using Lemma 1.3 (contraction-independence) followed by reverse
martingale convergence. -/

/-- **Aldous' third proof of de Finetti's theorem.**

If `X` is contractable, then `X₁, X₂, ...` are conditionally i.i.d. given the
tail σ-algebra `𝒯_X = ⋂_n σ(θ_n X)`.

**Proof structure:**
1. From contractability: `(X_m, θ_m X) =^d (X_k, θ_k X)` for `k ≤ m ≤ n`
2. Define `𝒯_X = ⋂_n σ(θ_n X)` (tail σ-algebra)
3. Apply Lemma 1.3 + reverse martingale convergence:
   ```
   P[X_m ∈ B | θ_m X] = P[X_k ∈ B | θ_m X] → P[X_k ∈ B | 𝒯_X]
   ```
4. Conclude: `P[X_m ∈ B | θ_m X] = P[X_m ∈ B | 𝒯_X] = P[X_1 ∈ B | 𝒯_X]`
5. First equality: `X_m ⊥⊥_{𝒯_X} θ_m X` for all `m`
6. By iteration: `X₁, X₂, ...` conditionally independent given `𝒯_X`
7. Second equality: conditional laws agree, giving conditional i.i.d.
