# de Finetti's Theorem - Martingale Proof

This file provides the **main theorem statements** for de Finetti's theorem
proved using the martingale approach (Kallenberg's "third proof").

## Proof architecture

The martingale approach follows this structure:

1. **ViaMartingale.lean**: Contains all the proof machinery:
   - Reverse martingale convergence for conditional expectations
   - Tail σ-algebra factorization lemmas
   - Construction of the directing measure ν via condExpKernel
   - Finite-dimensional product formula

2. **This file**: Provides clean public-facing theorem statements that
   assemble the machinery from ViaMartingale.lean

## Main results

* `conditionallyIID_of_contractable`: Contractable ⇒ ConditionallyIID
* `deFinetti_viaMartingale`: Exchangeable ⇒ ConditionallyIID (uses contractability)
* `deFinetti_equivalence`: Contractable ⇔ (Exchangeable ∧ ConditionallyIID)

/-- **Contractable implies conditionally i.i.d.** (via Martingale).

This is the core result proved using reverse martingale convergence.
The proof constructs the directing measure ν via conditional expectation kernels
and verifies the finite-dimensional product formula.

**Reference**: Kallenberg (2005), page 27-28, "Third proof".

**Current status:** ⚠️ BLOCKED - Waiting for 3 sorries in ViaMartingale.lean to be resolved

  -- IsProbabilityMeasure → IsFiniteMeasure (needed for condExpKernel)
  haveI : IsFiniteMeasure μ := inferInstance

  -- Step 1: Use the axiomatized directing measure
  set ν : Ω → Measure α := directingMeasure (μ := μ) X with hν_def

  -- Step 2: Prove ν is a probability measure for each ω (axiom)
  have hν_prob : ∀ ω, IsProbabilityMeasure (ν ω) :=
    directingMeasure_isProb (μ := μ) X

  -- Step 3: Prove measurability of ν (axiom)
  have hν_meas : ∀ B : Set α, MeasurableSet B → Measurable (fun ω => ν ω B) :=
    directingMeasure_measurable_eval (μ := μ) X hX_meas

  -- Step 4: Prove the conditional law property
  -- Uses directingMeasure_X0_marginal + conditional_law_eq_directingMeasure
  have hν_law : ∀ n B, MeasurableSet B →
      (fun ω => (ν ω B).toReal) =ᵐ[μ] μ[Set.indicator B (fun _ => (1 : ℝ)) ∘ (X n) | tailSigma X] := by
    intro n B hB
    -- This is exactly what conditional_law_eq_directingMeasure provides
    exact conditional_law_eq_directingMeasure (μ := μ) X hContract hX_meas n B hB

  -- Step 5: Apply finite_product_formula (only needed for StrictMono k per refined definition)
  have hProduct : ∀ (m : ℕ) (k : Fin m → ℕ), StrictMono k →
      Measure.map (fun ω => fun i : Fin m => X (k i) ω) μ

  -- Step 6: Package as ConditionallyIID
  -- Note: With the refined definition of ConditionallyIID (requiring StrictMono k),
  -- we only need to verify the product formula for strictly monotone index functions.
  -- For non-strictly-monotone functions (with repeated indices), the correct law
  -- involves a duplication map from the distinct-indices product, which follows
  -- trivially from the StrictMono case. See ConditionallyIID.lean for details.

/-- **De Finetti's Theorem (Martingale proof)**: Exchangeable ⇒ ConditionallyIID.

Uses the fact that exchangeable sequences are contractable.

/-- **Three-way equivalence (Kallenberg Theorem 1.1 via Martingale)**:
Exchangeable ⇔ Contractable ⇔ ConditionallyIID.

This establishes that all three properties are equivalent for sequences on Borel spaces.

**Proof structure**:
- Exchangeable ⇔ Contractable: `contractable_of_exchangeable` and converse (Contractability.lean)
- Contractable → ConditionallyIID: `conditionallyIID_of_contractable` (this file)
- ConditionallyIID → Exchangeable: `exchangeable_of_conditionallyIID` (ConditionallyIID.lean)
