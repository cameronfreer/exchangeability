# de Finetti's Theorem via Koopman Operator

**Kallenberg's "first proof"** of de Finetti's theorem using the Mean Ergodic
Theorem and Koopman operator. This proof has the **heaviest dependencies**.

## Proof approach

1. Apply the Mean Ergodic Theorem to show Birkhoff averages converge to the
   orthogonal projection onto the fixed-point subspace
2. Identify this projection with conditional expectation onto the shift-invariant σ-algebra
3. Use dominated convergence to show the conditional expectation has product form
4. Apply monotone class theorem to extend from cylinders to the full σ-algebra

## Main definitions

* `cylinderFunction`: Functions depending only on finitely many coordinates
* `productCylinder`: Product of functions evaluated at different coordinates
* `shiftedCylinder`: Cylinder function composed with shift^n

## Main results

* `deFinetti_viaKoopman`: **Main theorem** - contractable implies conditionally i.i.d.
* Supporting lemmas for Birkhoff averages and conditional expectations

## Current Status (updated 2025-12-25)

✅ **Compiles successfully**
✅ **All infrastructure sections complete** - no sorries in Sections 1, 2, 5, 7, 9
✅ **Major proofs complete** - L¹ Cesàro convergence, cylinder functions, main theorem
✅ **Only 4 active sorries remain** - all in Sections 3-4 (MET/factorization)

**Active sorries** (4 total):

1. **Line 1626** - `condexp_product_factorization_consecutive` inductive step
   - Needs conditional independence for product factorization
   - Strategy: Use `condIndep_simpleFunc` from CondIndep.lean

2. **Line 1713** - `condexp_product_factorization_general` inductive step
   - Depends on `condexp_product_factorization_consecutive`
   - Once ax is done, this follows from shift invariance

3. **Line 4460** - `ce_lipschitz_convergence`
   - L¹-Lipschitz property of CE for products
   - Detailed proof outline in comments (squeeze theorem + CE Lipschitz)

4. **Line 4720** - `h_tower_of_lagConst_from_one`
   - Tower property via Cesàro averaging
   - Avoids false k=0 lag constancy, uses indices from 1

**Commented-out sorries** (not blocking, for reference only):
- Lines 1647, 2372, 5212 - In comment blocks, not active code

## Dependencies

❌ **Heavy** - Requires ergodic theory, Mean Ergodic Theorem, orthogonal projections
✅ **Deep connection** to dynamical systems and ergodic theory
✅ **Generalizes** beyond exchangeability to measure-preserving systems
✅ **Extensive mathlib integration** - conditional expectation, kernels, independence

/-! ### OLD PROOF (kept for reference - can be moved to AxiomsForDeFinetti to prove the axiom)

The construction below shows how to prove kernel independence implies measure-level independence
via dyadic approximation. This can be used to eventually prove the axiom
`Kernel.IndepFun.ae_measure_indepFun`.

-- Step 2 (Step B): Extend from simple to bounded measurable functions via dyadic approximation
  -- Kernel.IndepFun X Y κ μ means: Kernel.Indep (comap X _) (comap Y _) κ μ
  -- which unfolds to: Kernel.IndepSets {s | MeasurableSet[comap X] s} {t | MeasurableSet[comap Y] t} κ μ
  -- which means: ∀ s t in those sets, ∀ᵐ a ∂μ, κ a (s ∩ t) = κ a s * κ a t

  -- For bounded measurable functions, we use the integral characterization.
  -- The key is that Kernel.IndepFun gives us enough structure to apply
  -- the measure-level integral factorization theorem for ae every a.

  -- Step 1: Establish integrability
  obtain ⟨CX, hCX⟩ := hX_bd
  obtain ⟨CY, hCY⟩ := hY_bd

  have hX_int : ∀ a, Integrable X (κ a) := fun a => by
    refine Exchangeability.Probability.integrable_of_bounded ?_ ?_
    · exact hX
    · exact ⟨CX, fun ω => hCX ω⟩

  have hY_int : ∀ a, Integrable Y (κ a) := fun a => by
    refine Exchangeability.Probability.integrable_of_bounded ?_ ?_
    · exact hY
    · exact ⟨CY, fun ω => hCY ω⟩

  have hXY_int : ∀ a, Integrable (fun ω => X ω * Y ω) (κ a) := fun a => by
    refine Exchangeability.Probability.integrable_of_bounded ?_ ?_
    · exact hX.mul hY
    · exact ⟨CX * CY, fun ω => by
        have : |X ω * Y ω| = |X ω| * |Y ω| := abs_mul (X ω) (Y ω)
        rw [this]
        exact mul_le_mul (hCX ω) (hCY ω) (abs_nonneg _) (le_trans (abs_nonneg _) (hCX ω))⟩

  -- Step 2 (Step B): Extend from simple to bounded measurable functions

  -- Key observation: For measurable X : Ω → ℝ, we have:
  -- - X is measurable means X⁻¹(B) is measurable for all Borel sets B
  -- - Hence X⁻¹(B) is measurable in both the ambient σ-algebra AND in comap X
  -- - This means we can use standard simple function approximation

  -- Since X, Y are measurable bounded functions, they can be approximated by
  -- simple functions. The natural approximation satisfies both measurability conditions.

  -- However, for X : Ω → ℝ measurable, approximating simple functions typically have the form
  -- ∑ᵢ cᵢ · 1_{X⁻¹(Iᵢ)} where Iᵢ are intervals.
  -- These sets X⁻¹(Iᵢ) are measurable in the ambient space (by measurability of X)
  -- AND in comap X (by definition).

  -- The full proof requires:
  -- Step B.1: Construct approximations Xₙ, Yₙ as simple functions
  -- Step B.2: Verify they satisfy both measurability conditions for Step A
  -- Step B.3: Apply Step A to get factorization for each (Xₙ, Yₙ) pair
  -- Step B.4: Combine countably many ae statements using ae_all_iff
  -- Step B.5: Pass to limit using dominated convergence

  -- The key technical lemma needed:
  -- If X : Ω → ℝ is measurable and S ⊆ ℝ is Borel, then:
  --   - X⁻¹(S) is measurable in the ambient σ-algebra on Ω
  --   - X⁻¹(S) is measurable in MeasurableSpace.comap X
  -- This follows from the definition of measurable function and comap.

  -- Step B.1: Establish dual measurability of preimages
  have h_preimage_meas : ∀ (S : Set ℝ), MeasurableSet S →
      MeasurableSet (X ⁻¹' S) ∧ MeasurableSet[MeasurableSpace.comap X inferInstance] (X ⁻¹' S) := by
    intro S hS
    constructor
    · exact hX hS  -- X measurable implies preimages measurable
    · exact ⟨S, hS, rfl⟩  -- Preimage is in comap by definition

  have h_preimage_meas_Y : ∀ (S : Set ℝ), MeasurableSet S →
      MeasurableSet (Y ⁻¹' S) ∧ MeasurableSet[MeasurableSpace.comap Y inferInstance] (Y ⁻¹' S) := by
    intro S hS
    constructor
    · exact hY hS
    · exact ⟨S, hS, rfl⟩

  -- Step B.2: Approximate X and Y by simple functions
  -- For now, we assert the existence of such approximations
  -- (A rigorous proof would construct them using dyadic intervals)

  -- The key properties we need:
  -- For each n, there exist finite types ιₙ, κₙ, coefficients, and sets such that:
  -- - Xₙ = ∑ᵢ aᵢ · 1_{Aᵢ} with Aᵢ = X⁻¹(Sᵢ) for Borel Sᵢ
  -- - Yₙ = ∑ⱼ bⱼ · 1_{Bⱼ} with Bⱼ = Y⁻¹(Tⱼ) for Borel Tⱼ
  -- - |Xₙ| ≤ CX and |Yₙ| ≤ CY (uniformly bounded)
  -- - Xₙ → X and Yₙ → Y pointwise (and in L^1)

  -- With such approximations, we would:
  -- Step B.3: Apply Step A to each (Xₙ, Yₙ) pair
  -- Using h_preimage_meas, we know the sets satisfy both measurability conditions.
  -- Step A gives: ∀ n m, ∀ᵐ a, ∫ Xₙ Yₘ = (∫ Xₙ)(∫ Yₘ)

  -- Step B.4: Combine using ae_all_iff
  -- Since n, m range over ℕ × ℕ (countable), we can combine:
  -- ∀ᵐ a, ∀ n m, ∫ Xₙ Yₘ d(κ a) = (∫ Xₙ d(κ a))(∫ Yₘ d(κ a))

  -- Step B.5: Pass to limit using dominated convergence
  -- On the ae-good set:
  -- - Xₙ Yₘ → XY pointwise (products of convergent sequences)
  -- - |Xₙ Yₘ| ≤ CX · CY (uniform domination)
  -- - DCT: ∫ Xₙ Yₘ → ∫ XY
  -- - Similarly: (∫ Xₙ)(∫ Yₘ) → (∫ X)(∫ Y)
  -- - Equality passes to the limit

  -- The actual implementation requires:
  -- 1. Either explicit construction of Xₙ, Yₙ (using MeasureTheory.SimpleFunc API)
  -- 2. Or invoking a density/approximation theorem from mathlib
  -- 3. Verifying all the convergence and measurability details

  -- Step B.6: Set up approximation structure more explicitly

  -- We assert the existence of approximating sequences with the right properties
  have approximation_exists :
    ∃ (approx_X : ℕ → Ω → ℝ) (approx_Y : ℕ → Ω → ℝ),
      -- Each approximation is a simple function satisfying Step A's requirements

/-! ### Removed dead code (2025-12-04)

The lemma `condexp_pair_factorization` was removed as dead code.
It required the axiom `kernel_integral_product_factorization` which is bypassed by
`condexp_pair_factorization_MET` (line ~2210) that proves pair factorization
directly via the Mean Ergodic Theorem.

/-! ### Use the axiomatized product factorization to close the theorem -/

/-- Conditional expectation factorizes through the regular conditional distribution.

Assuming conditional independence of coordinates given the tail σ-algebra,
the conditional expectation of a product equals the product of integrals
against the conditional distribution ν.

**Proof structure note** (218 lines, lines 4977-5194):
The proof body is commented out and delegated to `condexp_product_factorization_consecutive`.
The commented-out proof shows the intended inductive structure:
- Base case: m = 0 (trivial)
- Inductive step: split product into (first m factors) * (last factor)
  - Apply IH to first m factors
  - Use `condexp_coordinate_via_ν` for last factor
  - Combine using conditional independence

This proof is blocked on finishing the conditional independence machinery.
Once `hciid` is properly implemented (currently `True`), the proof can be uncommented
and refined. No immediate subdivision needed - the inductive structure is natural.

/-- Factorization theorem: conditional expectation of cylinder has product form.

This is Kallenberg's conclusion: E[∏ₖ fₖ(ξᵢₖ) | 𝓘_ξ] = ∏ₖ ∫fₖ dν a.s.,
where ν is the conditional law of ξ₁ given 𝓘_ξ.

The proof combines:
1. Existence of regular conditional distributions (ergodic decomposition)
2. The extreme members lemma (`extremeMembers_agree`)
3. Factorization through the conditional kernel
4. Shift-invariance of the tail σ-algebra

This completes Kallenberg's "First proof" approach using the mean ergodic theorem. -/

/-- **de Finetti's Theorem via Koopman Operator (Main Result)**

For an exchangeable sequence on a standard Borel space, there exists a random
probability measure ν such that, conditioned on the tail σ-algebra, the sequence
is i.i.d. with law ν.

**Statement**: If (ξₙ) is an exchangeable sequence of random variables taking values
in a standard Borel space α, then there exists a regular conditional distribution
ν : Ω[α] → Measure α such that:

1. ν(ω) is a probability measure for μ-a.e. ω
2. Conditional on the tail σ-algebra, the coordinates are i.i.d. with law ν(ω)
3. The marginal distribution μ equals ∫ ν(ω)^⊗ℕ dμ(ω)

**Proof strategy** (Kallenberg's "first proof"):
1. Use shift-invariance to apply Mean Ergodic Theorem
2. Construct regular conditional distribution ν via condExpKernel
3. Show ν is shift-invariant (extremeMembers_agree)
4. Prove conditional independence via factorization (condexp_cylinder_factorizes)
5. Apply monotone class theorem to extend from cylinders to full σ-algebra

**Current status**: Main infrastructure in place, remaining gaps:
- Conditional independence establishment (needs `Kernel.iIndepFun` development)
- Shift-invariance circularity resolution
- Several large proofs requiring mathlib additions

/-! ### Bridge Lemma: Connect conditional expectation factorization to measure products

This is the key technical lemma connecting ViaKoopman's factorization results to
CommonEnding's `conditional_iid_from_directing_measure` infrastructure.

Given measurable sets B_i, the integral of the product of indicators equals the
integral of the product of measures ν(ω)(B_i). This is exactly the "bridge condition"
needed by CommonEnding.
-/

/-! ### Exchangeable implies ConditionallyIID

This theorem shows the complete logical chain from exchangeability to ConditionallyIID,
assuming the `indicator_product_bridge` lemma. The bridge lemma itself requires
conditional independence, which must come from ergodic theory or martingale theory.

**Proof strategy:**
1. Start with exchangeability → contractability (proven in Contractability.lean)
2. Use contractability to get measure-preserving shift
3. Construct ν via regular conditional distribution (rcdKernel)
4. Apply indicator_product_bridge to get the bridge condition
5. Use CommonEnding.conditional_iid_from_directing_measure to conclude
