# Directing Measure Integrals: Bridge Lemma and Conditional Expectation

This file establishes the bridge lemma connecting the directing measure to conditional
expectation: for bounded measurable `f`,

  ∫ f dν(ω) = E[f(X₀) | tail](ω)  a.e.

The proof routes through the kernel-level identification
`directing_measure_ae_eq_condExpKernel_map` plus mathlib's
`condExp_ae_eq_integral_condExpKernel`.

## Main result

* `directing_measure_integral_eq_condExp`: bridge lemma (routes through
  `DirectingMeasureBridge`).

## References

/-- **Bridge lemma:** For bounded measurable `f`,

`fun ω => ∫ x, f x ∂(directing_measure X … ω)` agrees a.e. with the conditional expectation
`μ[fun ω => f (X 0 ω) | tailSigma X]`.

The proof routes through the kernel-level bridge
`directing_measure_ae_eq_condExpKernel_map` and mathlib's
`condExp_ae_eq_integral_condExpKernel`, replacing what was previously a hand-built
monotone-class extension from `Iic` indicators.

The `[StandardBorelSpace Ω]` assumption comes from `condExpKernel`. -/
