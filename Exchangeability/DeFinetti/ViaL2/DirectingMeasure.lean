# Directing Measure Construction via Carathéodory Extension

This file constructs the directing measure ν : Ω → Measure ℝ for the L² proof
of de Finetti's theorem. The directing measure is built from the L¹ limits
of Cesàro averages via Carathéodory extension.

## Main definitions

* `cdf_from_alpha`: The regularized CDF via Stieltjes extension
* `directing_measure`: The directing measure built from the CDF

## Main results

* `directing_measure_isProbabilityMeasure`: ν(ω) is a probability measure
* `directing_measure_integral_eq_condExp`: Integration against directing measure equals condExp

## Step 6: Build directing measure ν via Carathéodory extension

Given the family of limit functions α_f for bounded measurable f, we construct
the directing measure ν : Ω → Measure ℝ such that:
- ν(ω) is a probability measure for each ω
- ω ↦ ν(ω)(B) is measurable for each Borel B
- α_f(ω) = ∫ f dν(ω) for all bounded measurable f

The construction proceeds via the Carathéodory extension theorem:
1. For intervals (-∞, t], use α_{𝟙_{(-∞,t]}} to define a pre-measure
2. Verify this is a valid CDF (monotone, right-continuous, limits 0 and 1)
3. Extend to Borel sets via Carathéodory
4. Establish measurability of ω ↦ ν(ω)(B) using monotone class theorem

This is the "lightest path" mentioned in the original plan.

This is the a.e. version of the endpoint limit. The statement for all ω cannot be
proven from the L¹ construction since `alphaIic` is defined via existential L¹ choice.

**Proof strategy:**
Combine the a.e. equality `alphaIic =ᵐ alphaIicCE` with `alphaIicCE_ae_tendsto_zero_atBot`.
Since both are a.e. statements and we take countable intersection over integers, we
get a.e. convergence of `alphaIic` along the integer sequence `-(n:ℝ)`.

/-- Build the directing measure ν from the CDF.

For each ω ∈ Ω, we construct ν(ω) as the probability measure on ℝ with CDF
given by t ↦ cdf_from_alpha X ω t.

This is defined directly using `stieltjesOfMeasurableRat.measure`, which gives a
probability measure for ALL ω (not just a.e.) because the `stieltjesOfMeasurableRat`
construction patches the null set automatically. -/

## Bridge Lemma: Integral against directing measure equals conditional expectation

This is the key Kallenberg insight: the directing measure ν(ω) is the conditional distribution
of X₀ given the tail σ-algebra. Therefore:

  ∫ f dν(ω) = E[f(X₀) | tail](ω)  a.e.

**Proof Strategy:**
1. **Base case (Iic indicators):** By Stieltjes construction,
   `∫ 1_{Iic t} dν(ω) = alphaIic t ω = alphaIicCE t ω = E[1_{Iic t}(X₀)|tail](ω)` a.e.

2. **Extension:** Iic sets form a π-system generating the Borel σ-algebra.
   By measure extensionality, two probability measures agreeing on Iic agree everywhere.
   The same linearity/continuity argument extends to all bounded measurable f.

This lemma is the bridge that allows us to go from:
- `cesaro_to_condexp_L2`: α = E[f(X₀)|tail]
to:
- `directing_measure_integral`: α = ∫f dν

by transitivity.
-/

/-- **Base case:** For Iic indicators, the directing measure integral equals alphaIicCE.

This follows from:
1. Stieltjes construction: `∫ 1_{Iic t} dν(ω) = (ν(Iic t)).toReal`
2. Measure value: `(ν(Iic t)).toReal = stieltjesOfMeasurableRat t`
3. Stieltjes extension: `stieltjesOfMeasurableRat t = alphaIic t` a.e.
4. Identification: `alphaIic t =ᵐ alphaIicCE t` -/

/-! ### Helper Lemmas for Monotone Class Extension

The following lemmas build up the π-λ argument needed for `directing_measure_integral_eq_condExp`.
Each phase is factored out as a separate lemma with its own sorry to be filled.

**Phase A**: Indicators of Borel sets → tail-AEStronglyMeasurable
**Phase B**: Simple functions → tail-AEStronglyMeasurable (via linearity)
**Phase C**: Bounded measurable functions → tail-AEStronglyMeasurable (via DCT + limits)
-/

/-- **Phase A:** For all Borel sets s, ω ↦ ∫ 1_s dν(ω) is tail-AEStronglyMeasurable.

The π-λ argument:
1. Base case: `{Iic t | t ∈ ℝ}` is a π-system generating Borel ℝ
2. For Iic t: uses `directing_measure_integral_Iic_ae_eq_alphaIicCE` + `stronglyMeasurable_condExp`
3. For ∅: integral is 0 (constant)
4. For complement: ∫ 1_{sᶜ} dν = 1 - ∫ 1_s dν (probability measure)
5. For disjoint unions: ∫ 1_{⋃ fn} dν = ∑' ∫ 1_{fn n} dν (σ-additivity)
6. Apply `MeasurableSpace.induction_on_inter` with `borel_eq_generateFrom_Iic`

  -- PROOF STRATEGY: Conditional distribution uniqueness
  --
  -- The directing measure ν(ω) is constructed so that its CDF equals αIicCE:
  --   (ν(ω))(Iic t) = αIicCE t ω = E[1_{Iic t}(X₀)|tail](ω) a.e.
  --
  -- Since measures on ℝ are uniquely determined by their CDFs, and the conditional
  -- distribution of X₀ given tail is uniquely characterized by the same CDF values,
  -- we have ν(ω) = P_{X₀|tail}(ω) as measures for a.e. ω.
  --
  -- Therefore, for any bounded measurable f:
  --   ∫ f dν(ω) = E[f(X₀)|tail](ω) a.e.
  --
  -- The proof involves:
  -- 1. Base case: For Iic indicators, directing_measure_integral_Iic_ae_eq_alphaIicCE
  --    gives ∫ 1_{Iic t} dν(ω) =ᵐ αIicCE t ω = E[1_{Iic t}(X₀)|tail](ω)
  --
  -- 2. Extension: For general bounded measurable f, use:
  --    - Step functions approximation (via Ioc indicators)
  --    - Linearity of both ∫ · dν and E[·|tail]
  --    - Dominated convergence to pass to limit
  --
  -- OR use the uniqueness of conditional expectation:
  -- If h is m-measurable and ∫_A h dμ = ∫_A f(X₀) dμ for all m-measurable A,
  -- then h =ᵐ E[f(X₀)|m].
  --
  -- The key is showing ∫_A (∫ f dν) dμ = ∫_A f(X₀) dμ via Fubini and the
  -- conditional distribution property.
  -- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  --
  -- MATHEMATICAL CONTENT (to be formalized):
  --
  -- The proof requires showing that ν(ω) is the regular conditional distribution
  -- of X₀ given the tail σ-algebra. This follows from:
  -- 1. CDF agreement: For all t, (ν(ω))(Iic t) = E[1_{Iic t}(X₀)|tail](ω) a.e.
  -- 2. Measures are determined by CDFs (uniqueness)
  -- 3. Integration against measures determined by CDFs
  --
  -- The formalization uses ae_eq_condExp_of_forall_setIntegral_eq and requires:
  -- 1. Measurability of ω ↦ ∫ f dν(ω) w.r.t. tail σ-algebra
  -- 2. Set integral equality: ∫_A (∫ f dν) dμ = ∫_A f(X₀) dμ for tail-measurable A

/-- **Simplified directing measure integral via identification chain.**

This lemma proves that the L¹ limit α equals ∫f dν a.e. using the Kallenberg identification chain:
1. α = E[f(X₀)|tail]  (from `cesaro_to_condexp_L2`)
2. E[f(X₀)|tail] = ∫f dν  (from `directing_measure_integral_eq_condExp`)
3. Therefore α = ∫f dν by transitivity

This approach bypasses the Ioc/step function decomposition entirely, giving a much simpler proof.

**Key insight:** By uniqueness of L¹ limits, the L¹ limit from `weighted_sums_converge_L1`
equals the L² limit from `cesaro_to_condexp_L2` (since L² convergence implies L¹ on prob spaces).
