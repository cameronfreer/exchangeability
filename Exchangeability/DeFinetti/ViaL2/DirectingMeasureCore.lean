# Directing Measure Core: CDF and Measure Construction

This file defines the core components of the directing measure construction:
- `cdf_from_alpha`: The regularized CDF built from alpha functions via Stieltjes extension
- `directing_measure`: The probability measure on ℝ for each ω ∈ Ω
- `directing_measure_isProbabilityMeasure`: Proof that ν(ω) is a probability measure

## Main definitions

* `cdf_from_alpha`: CDF function F(ω,t) via `stieltjesOfMeasurableRat`
* `directing_measure`: The directing measure ν : Ω → Measure ℝ

## Main results

* `cdf_from_alpha_mono`: F(ω,·) is monotone nondecreasing
* `cdf_from_alpha_rightContinuous`: F(ω,·) is right-continuous
* `cdf_from_alpha_bounds`: 0 ≤ F(ω,t) ≤ 1
* `alphaIic_ae_tendsto_zero_at_bot`: a.e. limit 0 at -∞ for alphaIic
* `alphaIic_ae_tendsto_one_at_top`: a.e. limit 1 at +∞ for alphaIic
* `directing_measure_isProbabilityMeasure`: ν(ω) is a probability measure for each ω

## CDF Construction

The CDF F(ω,t) is built from the rational-valued alpha functions using
mathlib's `stieltjesOfMeasurableRat` construction, which automatically:
- Patches the null set where CDF properties might fail
- Ensures right-continuity and proper limits
- Produces a valid probability measure via Carathéodory extension

## A.e. endpoint limits for alphaIic

These lemmas establish a.e. convergence of `alphaIic` at ±∞ by combining:
1. The a.e. equality `alphaIic =ᵐ alphaIicCE` (from AlphaConvergence)
2. The a.e. convergence of `alphaIicCE` (from AlphaConvergence)
-/

/-- **A.e. convergence of α_{Iic t} → 0 as t → -∞ (along integers).**

This is the a.e. version of the endpoint limit. The statement for all ω cannot be
proven from the L¹ construction since `alphaIic` is defined via existential L¹ choice.

**Proof strategy:**
Combine the a.e. equality `alphaIic =ᵐ alphaIicCE` with `alphaIicCE_ae_tendsto_zero_atBot`.
Since both are a.e. statements and we take countable intersection over integers, we
get a.e. convergence of `alphaIic` along the integer sequence `-(n:ℝ)`.

-- **Note on `cdf_from_alpha_limits`:**
-- The axiom in MoreL2Helpers.lean requires the CDF limits to hold for ALL ω.
-- However, from the L¹ construction, we can only prove a.e. convergence:
-- - `alphaIic_ae_tendsto_zero_at_bot`: a.e. convergence to 0 as t → -∞
-- - `alphaIic_ae_tendsto_one_at_top`: a.e. convergence to 1 as t → +∞
--
-- The axiom should be weakened to an a.e. statement, and the `directing_measure`
-- construction should handle the null set by using a default probability measure
-- for ω outside the "good" set. This is a standard technique in probability theory.

## Directing Measure Definition

The directing measure ν(ω) is built from the CDF via mathlib's
`stieltjesOfMeasurableRat.measure` construction. This automatically
handles the null set patching and produces a probability measure for ALL ω.
-/

/-- Build the directing measure ν from the CDF.

For each ω ∈ Ω, we construct ν(ω) as the probability measure on ℝ with CDF
given by t ↦ cdf_from_alpha X ω t.

This is defined directly using `stieltjesOfMeasurableRat.measure`, which gives a
probability measure for ALL ω (not just a.e.) because the `stieltjesOfMeasurableRat`
construction patches the null set automatically. -/
