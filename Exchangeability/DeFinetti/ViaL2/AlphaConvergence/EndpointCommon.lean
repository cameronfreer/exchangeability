# Shared helper for the `alphaIicCE` endpoint limits

Both `alphaIicCE_ae_tendsto_zero_atBot` (`EndpointAtBot`) and
`alphaIicCE_ae_tendsto_one_atTop` (`EndpointAtTop`) need the same generic
measure-theoretic fact:

If a uniformly bounded sequence `f : ℕ → Ω → ℝ` converges pointwise a.e. (to
some `L`) and also converges to a *constant* `c` in L¹, then the pointwise
limit equals `c` a.e., so `f n ω → c` a.e.

This is the "L¹-limit-of-a-constant-identifies-the-pointwise-limit" lemma,
extracted into one private helper so the endpoint files can each derive
pointwise convergence to their target without duplicating the
dominated-convergence + `integral_eq_zero_iff_of_nonneg_ae` machinery.

/-- **A.e. pointwise limit equals the L¹-limit constant.**

If a uniformly bounded sequence `f : ℕ → Ω → ℝ` converges pointwise a.e. to
`L : Ω → ℝ` and also converges to a constant `c` in L¹ (in the sense that
`∫ |f n - c| → 0`), then `L = c` a.e., so `f n ω → c` for a.e. `ω`.

The proof routes through dominated convergence: `|f n - c|` is uniformly
bounded by `C + |c|`, converges pointwise a.e. to `|L - c|`, and has integrals
tending to `0`, so `∫ |L - c| = 0`. Since `|L - c| ≥ 0`, that forces `L = c`
