# Conditional Expectation Convergence from Contractability

This file proves that for contractable processes, conditional expectations
of indicators converge to the tail conditional expectation.

## Main results

* `condexp_convergence` - For k ≤ m, P[X_m ∈ B | θ_{m+1} X] = P[X_k ∈ B | θ_{m+1} X]
* `extreme_members_equal_on_tail` - P[X_m ∈ B | tail] = P[X_0 ∈ B | tail]

These are key steps in the martingale proof of de Finetti's theorem.

/-! ### Conditional expectation convergence from contractability -/

/-- **Conditional expectation convergence:** For k ≤ m, all coordinates look
the same when conditioned on the future filtration at level m.

This is the key convergence result: for k ≤ m and measurable set B,
```
P[X_m ∈ B | θ_{m+1} X] = P[X_k ∈ B | θ_{m+1} X]
```

**Proof:** Uses the CE bridge lemma from CondExp.lean with the measure equality from
contractability. The key insight is that deleting coordinates doesn't change the joint distribution
with the future, which implies conditional expectation equality by the bridge lemma. -/

  -- Use the CE bridge lemma with Y = X m, Y' = X k, Z = shiftRV X (m+1)
  -- The key is that futureFiltration X m = σ(shiftRV X (m+1)) by definition

/-- Conditional expectations of indicators are equal on the tail σ-algebra (tower proof).

For any contractable process X and measurable set B,
```
P[X_m ∈ B | tail] = P[X_0 ∈ B | tail]
```

**Proof:** Uses `condexp_convergence` at level m, then applies tower property
since tailSigma ≤ futureFiltration m.

This is an alternative proof using the tower property. See `extreme_members_equal_on_tail`
for the Kallenberg-style proof using reverse martingale convergence. -/

/-- Conditional expectations of indicators are equal on the tail σ-algebra.

For any contractable process X and measurable set B,
```
P[X_m ∈ B | tail] = P[X_0 ∈ B | tail]
```

**Proof (Kallenberg route):**
1. By `condExp_indicator_revFiltration_eq_tail`, conditioning on `revFiltration X (m+1)`
   equals conditioning on `tailSigma X` (via reverse martingale convergence).
2. By `condexp_convergence`, both indicators have equal conditional expectation
   given `futureFiltration X m = revFiltration X (m+1)`.
3. Combine to get equality on the tail.

This is the Kallenberg-style proof using the chain lemma and reverse martingale
convergence. See `extreme_members_equal_on_tail_via_tower` for an alternative
proof using the tower property. -/
