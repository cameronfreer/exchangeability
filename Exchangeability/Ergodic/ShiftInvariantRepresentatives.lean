# Shift-invariant representatives via limsup construction

This file constructs canonical shift-invariant representatives for functions that are
almost shift-invariant (i.e., `g ∘ shift = g` a.e.).

## Main definitions

* `gRep`: Canonical shift-invariant representative via limsup along the orbit.
* `mkShiftInvariantRep`: Given an a.e. shift-invariant function, construct a representative
  that is literally shift-invariant and measurable with respect to `shiftInvariantSigma`.
* `exists_shiftInvariantRepresentative`: Existence theorem for shift-invariant representatives.

## Main results

* `gRep_measurable`: The limsup representative is measurable.
* `gRep_shiftInvariant`: The limsup representative is pointwise shift-invariant.
* `gRep_ae_eq_of_constant_orbit`: The representative agrees with the original a.e.
* `exists_shiftInvariantFullMeasureSet`: Construction of shift-invariant full-measure sets.

## Mathematical idea

For each `ω`, consider the orbit sequence `g0(ω), g0(shift ω), g0(shift² ω), ...`.
If `g0` is almost invariant, then this sequence is eventually constant on a full-measure set.
Taking the limsup gives a well-defined function that is:
1. **Shift-invariant**: `gRep g0 (shift ω) = gRep g0 ω` for all `ω` (not just a.e.)
2. **Measurable**: Inherits measurability from `g0`
3. **Almost equal**: `gRep g0 =ᵐ[μ] g0` when `g0` is almost invariant

This construction avoids the Axiom of Choice by using a canonical limit process rather than
selecting arbitrary representatives from equivalence classes.

/-! ### Limsup construction for shift-invariant representatives

Given a function `g0 : Ω[α] → ℝ` that is almost shift-invariant
(i.e., `g0 ∘ shift = g0` a.e.), we construct a pointwise shift-invariant
representative `gRep g0` using a limsup along the orbit.

**Key property**: If `g0 (shift^[n] ω) = g0 ω` for all `n`, then `gRep g0 ω = g0 ω`.

/-- **Limsup along shift orbit (extended real valued).**

For a function `g0 : Ω[α] → ℝ`, this computes the limsup of the sequence
`g0(ω), g0(shift ω), g0(shift² ω), ...` in the extended reals.

This is the first step in constructing a shift-invariant representative.

/-- **Canonical shift-invariant representative via limsup.**

Given `g0 : Ω[α] → ℝ`, this constructs a shift-invariant function `gRep g0` by taking
the limsup along the shift orbit and converting back to ℝ.

**Properties**:
- If `g0` is measurable, so is `gRep g0` (see `gRep_measurable`)
- `gRep g0 (shift ω) = gRep g0 ω` for all `ω` (see `gRep_shiftInvariant`)
- If `g0 (shift^[n] ω) = g0 ω` for all `n`, then `gRep g0 ω = g0 ω`
  (see `gRep_eq_of_constant_orbit`)
- If `g0 ∘ shift =ᵐ[μ] g0`, then `gRep g0 =ᵐ[μ] g0`
  (see `gRep_ae_eq_of_constant_orbit`)

/-! ### Construction of shift-invariant representatives

The main challenge in working with shift-invariant functions is that almost-everywhere
equality `g ∘ shift =ᵐ[μ] g` doesn't immediately give a pointwise invariant function.

**Goal**: Given `g : Ω[α] → ℝ` with `g ∘ shift =ᵐ[μ] g`, construct
`g' : Ω[α] → ℝ` such that:
1. `g' (shift ω) = g' ω` for ALL `ω` (pointwise, not just a.e.)
2. `g' =ᵐ[μ] g` (almost equal to the original)
3. `g'` is measurable with respect to `shiftInvariantSigma`

**Strategy**:
1. Find a shift-invariant full-measure set `S` where `g` is constant along orbits
2. Use `gRep` to construct a pointwise invariant representative
3. Prove the representative agrees with `g` almost everywhere

This avoids Choice by using the canonical `gRep` construction instead of selecting
arbitrary representatives.

/-- **Existence of shift-invariant full-measure sets.**

Build a shift-invariant full-measure set on which `g ∘ shift = g` holds pointwise.
The construction iterates the equality set and intersects all pullbacks to obtain a
forward-invariant set on which the equality holds everywhere. -/
