# De Finetti's Theorem

This module contains the formalization of de Finetti's theorem for infinite
exchangeable sequences.

## Main theorem

* `deFinetti`: An infinite exchangeable sequence on a Borel space is conditionally
  i.i.d. given the tail σ-algebra.

## Three proof approaches (Kallenberg 2005)

This formalization keeps track of all proofs of Theorem 1.1 highlighted by
Kallenberg:

1. **First proof** (`KoopmanApproach`): Uses the Mean Ergodic Theorem via the
   Koopman operator on L²(μ). The key insight is that Birkhoff averages converge
   to the conditional expectation onto the shift-invariant σ-algebra, which can be
   shown to have product form.

2. **Second proof** (`L2Approach`): Uses an elementary L² contractability bound
   (Lemma 1.2) that directly shows convergence of empirical distributions without
   invoking the full ergodic theory machinery.

3. **Third proof** (`MartingaleApproach`): Follows Aldous' martingale argument,
   relying on a contraction/independence lemma and reverse martingale convergence
   for the tail σ-algebra. The current file provides scaffolding for this route.

## Conditionally i.i.d. sequences

### Definition from `Exchangeability.ConditionallyIID`

A sequence `X : ℕ → Ω → α` is **conditionally i.i.d.** with respect to measure `μ` if:
```lean
∃ ν : Ω → Measure α,
  (∀ ω, IsProbabilityMeasure (ν ω)) ∧
  ∀ (m : ℕ) (k : Fin m → ℕ),
    Measure.map (fun ω => fun i : Fin m => X (k i) ω) μ
      = μ.bind (fun ω => Measure.pi fun _ : Fin m => ν ω)
```

This expresses that:
1. There exists a probability kernel `ν : Ω → Measure α`
2. For every finite selection of indices `k : Fin m → ℕ`
3. The joint distribution of `(X (k 0), ..., X (k (m-1)))` equals
4. The mixture `μ.bind (ν ↦ ν^⊗m)` of i.i.d. product measures

### Key Properties

- **From mathlib**: Uses `Measure.pi` (finite products) and `Measure.bind` (Giry monad)
- **Proved in ConditionallyIID.lean**: `exchangeable_of_conditionallyIID`
- **For de Finetti**: The kernel is tail-measurable (constructed via ergodic theory)

### DirectingMeasure structure

An alternative bundled formulation that explicitly carries the kernel and its properties.
-/

/-- A directing measure for a process `X` is a tail-measurable Markov kernel.

This bundles the kernel with its key properties needed for de Finetti's theorem.

**Note**: This is an alternative formulation that explicitly carries the kernel.
The main `ConditionallyIID` definition is existential and doesn't expose the kernel.

## Main theorems to be proved

### Kallenberg Theorem 1.1 Structure

The theorem establishes a three-way equivalence (for Borel spaces):
- **(i)** ξ is **contractable**
- **(ii)** ξ is **exchangeable**  
- **(iii)** ξ is **conditionally i.i.d.**

**Key insight from Kallenberg**: All three proofs start with contractability (i) and 
directly establish conditionally i.i.d. (iii), with exchangeability (ii) coming along
automatically.

**Proof cycle**:
- **(i) → (iii)**: The three approaches (Koopman, L², Martingale) all prove this directly
  - First proof (page 26): "If ξ is contractable..." uses mean ergodic theorem
  - Second proof (page 27): "If ξ is contractable..." uses L² bounds
  - Third proof (page 27): "If ξ is contractable, then..." uses martingale convergence
  - All three share the common ending in `Exchangeability.DeFinetti.CommonEnding`
- **(iii) → (ii)**: `exchangeable_of_conditionallyIID` ✓ **PROVED** in `ConditionallyIID.lean`
- **(ii) → (i)**: `contractable_of_exchangeable` ✓ **PROVED** in `Contractability.lean`
-/

/-- **Contractable implies conditionally i.i.d.** (for Borel spaces).
This is the main result that all three proof approaches establish.

The three approaches:
1. **Koopman approach**: Mean Ergodic Theorem via L² convergence
2. **L² approach**: Elementary contractability bounds (Lemma 1.2)  
3. **Martingale approach**: Aldous' argument via reverse martingale convergence (Lemma 1.3)

All three share the common ending in `CommonEnding.lean` that constructs the
directing measure and applies the monotone class theorem.

TODO: Prove using one of the three approaches. -/

## Kallenberg Theorem 1.1: de Finetti-Ryll-Nardzewski Equivalence
-/

/-- **Kallenberg Theorem 1.1** (de Finetti, Ryll-Nardzewski): 
For infinite sequences in Borel spaces, the following are equivalent:
- **(i)** The sequence is **contractable**
- **(ii)** The sequence is **exchangeable**
- **(iii)** The sequence is **conditionally i.i.d.**

**Reference**: Kallenberg (2005), *Probabilistic Symmetries and Invariance Principles*,
Theorem 1.1 (page 26).

**Proof structure** (three-way equivalence established via):
- **(iii) → (ii)**: `exchangeable_of_conditionallyIID` (in `ConditionallyIID.lean`) ✓ **PROVED**
- **(ii) → (i)**: `contractable_of_exchangeable` (in `Contractability.lean`) ✓ **PROVED**
- **(i) → (ii)**: `exchangeable_of_contractable` (ergodic theory) - **AXIOM**
- **(ii) → (iii)**: `conditionallyIID_of_exchangeable` (three proofs share common ending) - **AXIOM**

The two axioms are the deep results requiring ergodic theory. All three proof approaches
(Koopman, L², Martingale) share a common ending in `CommonEnding.lean` for (ii) → (iii).
