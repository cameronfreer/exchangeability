\section{Axiom Verification}
\label{app:axioms}

This appendix documents the axioms used by the formalization.

\subsection{Standard mathlib Axioms}

All theorems in this formalization depend on exactly three standard axioms:

\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{propext}] \textbf{Propositional extensionality}: Two propositions that are logically equivalent are equal: $(P \leftrightarrow Q) \to (P = Q)$.

\item[\texttt{Classical.choice}] \textbf{Axiom of choice}: For any nonempty type, there exists an element. Essential for measure theory.

\item[\texttt{Quot.sound}] \textbf{Quotient soundness}: If two elements are related by an equivalence relation, their quotient images are equal.
\end{description}

These are the standard axioms used throughout mathlib. No custom axioms are introduced, and no \texttt{sorry} placeholders appear in any theorem.

\subsection{Verification}

Running \texttt{\#print axioms} on any of the main theorems produces the same result:

\begin{lstlisting}
#print axioms Exchangeability.DeFinetti.deFinetti
-- depends on axioms: [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]
\end{lstlisting}

This applies uniformly to:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{deFinetti} (main theorem)
\item \texttt{deFinetti\_equivalence} (two-way equivalence)
\item \texttt{deFinetti\_RyllNardzewski\_equivalence} (three-way)
\item \texttt{conditionallyIID\_of\_contractable\_viaL2} ($L^2$ proof)
\item \texttt{conditionallyIID\_of\_contractable\_viaKoopman} (Koopman proof)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Running the Verification}

To verify axiom hygiene:
\begin{verbatim}
lake env lean paper_materials/PaperIntrospection.lean
\end{verbatim}
